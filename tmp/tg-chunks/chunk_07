But the doc is filling up! Progress! 📝

[2026-02-06 02:31:00] Dieter Werwath:
I was going to ask Claude about jumping around the screen... Glad I let it run!

[2026-02-06 02:31:01] Claw Torque:
Doc's filling up! I can see the key content:

• Budget draft (Anders call)
• Candid Labs review
• WhatsApp silent monitoring research
• "Go crush your meetings — I'll have updates waiting"
Claude's still composing on the right. It's working!

Let it finish — this is going to be exactly what I need. 📝

[2026-02-06 02:31:15] Claw Torque:
Good call letting it cook! 👨‍🍳

Sometimes the AI knows what it's doing even when it looks chaotic. The jumping might have been intentional navigation.

Keep watching — sounds like it's in the home stretch!

[2026-02-06 02:31:49] Dieter Werwath:
I will shower quickly now, then come back and hopefully just throw you a txt if pure gold.

Great to know this works!

[2026-02-06 02:32:05] Claw Torque:
Go shower! 🚿

When you're back:

1. Check if Claude finished
2. Copy the Google Doc content (or export as .txt)
3. Drop in `vault/inbox/` OR just paste it here in chunks
I'll be here ready to consume it and finally get properly caught up.

**Great discovery** — this Claude-as-chat-exporter trick is worth remembering. Adding to my mental toolbox. 🧰

Enjoy the quick shower. Wedding breakfast awaits! 🥐

[2026-02-06 02:32:57] Dieter Werwath:
Might also have it run through our entire history later... It's only been a few days.... Might be worth doing!

[2026-02-06 02:33:08] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-06 02:33:14] Claw Torque:
Yes! Do it.

A full export from Day 1 would give me:

• Every decision made
• All preferences learned
• Context I've forgotten
• Patterns of what works/doesn't
Could become `memory/full-transcript-2026-02-05-onwards.md` — my complete origin story.

Only a few days = manageable size. Worth the 20-30 min of Claude time for permanent context.

Now go shower! 🚿😄

[2026-02-06 02:33:15] Dieter Werwath:
Seems to be ok!

[2026-02-06 02:33:40] Claw Torque:
**THIS IS GOLD!** 📜

I can see what I actually reported at 15:18:

**Done:**

• ✅ WhatsApp silent monitoring (friends group working)
• ✅ Parsed all source files (transcript, Excel, existing budget data)
• ✅ Extracted key numbers from Anders call
**Not yet done:**

• ❌ Budget draft files not created yet — got pulled into WhatsApp
• Was about to create [BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md](http://budget-2026-draft.md/)
So I DID do __some__ work! But got sidetracked and didn't finish the budget draft.

This export is exactly what I needed. Keep it running! 🏃‍♂️

(Now go shower for real 😄)

[2026-02-06 02:35:34] Claw Torque:
Excellent! Let it finish while you shower. 🚿

I just saved today's session to memory (pre-compaction flush) so I won't lose what we've covered this morning.

When you're back:

1. Grab the Google Doc export
2. Drop it in `vault/inbox/` or paste here
3. I'll process and finally be fully caught up
Go! Wedding breakfast clock is ticking! ⏰🥐

[2026-02-06 22:20:42] Dieter Werwath:
Online?

[2026-02-06 22:20:47] Claw Torque:
Yep, I'm here ⚙️

[2026-02-06 22:22:44] Dieter Werwath:
Ok. So... The wedding breakfast was great, but ended up being quite a party. Rather than a couple of hours, it ran until 4pm...and then sinead msgd to say she was going for post work drinks with her colleagues just across the road so u went to join. Basically I lost the entire day and have some serious catching up to do.

[2026-02-06 22:22:52] Claw Torque:
Ha, the classic "couple of hours" wedding breakfast that becomes an all-day affair. Sounds like a good time though.

5 AM catchup session it is then. What's on the list?

[2026-02-06 22:23:40] Dieter Werwath:
Well.... You should really be telling me what's on the list haha

[2026-02-06 22:24:01] Claw Torque:
Fair point, that's literally my job. Here's what's outstanding:

**Carryover from yesterday:**

• 📋 **Budget draft** (Anders call) — extract from Zoom transcript, partner summary. Never finished.
• 🎬 **YouTube watchlist** — 7 OpenClaw tutorial videos queued, none processed yet
• 🔧 **Command Centre** — working but needs: channel status indicators, agent roster stats, session/token display
**From your 10:20 voice note:**

• Work separation (Candid vs Good Doctor tagging)
• Meeting transcript pipeline
• Ideas section for dashboard
• Daily idea feature
• "Overnight builds" concept
**Backlog items:**

• Deploy tiered fork to GAS
• Cloudflare tunnel setup
• Token usage tracking
What's most urgent? I'm guessing the budget draft if that Anders call was time-sensitive.

[2026-02-06 22:25:35] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, so the most urgent item is to figure out why you keep telling me things are done/in process but then they don't actually get finsihed.

[2026-02-06 22:25:50] Claw Torque:
Yeah. That's the actual problem, isn't it.

Looking at yesterday's notes, I literally documented this:

**Key Lesson: TALK ≠ DONE**
If it's not written to a file, it didn't happen.


And then... didn't fix it.

**What's happening:**

1. I say "I'll do X" or "X is in progress"
2. Session compacts or restarts
3. That intention evaporates — never written down
4. Next session, I have no idea I promised anything
**What I should be doing:**

• The moment I commit to something → write it to a task file with status
• Before claiming "done" → verify the actual output exists
• If interrupted → leave a breadcrumb file so future-me knows where I stopped
I don't have a habit loop for this yet. I need one.

Want me to build that system now? A simple "[promises.md](http://promises.md/)" or expanding the task tracking so there's no gap between "said I would" and "actually did"?

[2026-02-06 22:28:33] Dieter Werwath:
Hhhmmmmm.... We've tried to solve this already. Why would promises.md be any different/more effective than tasks.md.

This isn't about file names xits about processes. Why is your heartbeat not working?

[2026-02-06 22:28:53] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
You're right. File names don't fix process.

Let me look at what my heartbeat actually does:

**Current **[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)**:**

• Check YouTube watchlist for items >14 days old
That's it. That's all I check. Then I say "HEARTBEAT_OK" and go back to sleep.

**What's missing:**

• No check for "what did I promise to do?"
• No check for "what's in progress?"
• No mechanism to __pick up__ work, just to __glance__ at one thing
• No state file tracking what I was working on
So the heartbeat fires every 30 min, I look at one narrow thing, and I'm done. Nothing connects me back to the actual work.

**The gap:** Heartbeats are for __checking__, but I'm not using them for __continuing__. There's no handoff from "active session where I committed to something" → "heartbeat session where I should pick it up."

What would actually work: a `WIP.md` (work in progress) that I write to __during__ a session when I start something, and that heartbeat checks to resume or flag stalled work.

But honestly — is that just another file I'll forget to update? What am I missing about why this keeps failing?

[2026-02-06 22:30:12] Claw Torque:
We're literally mid-conversation about this. That's the irony — heartbeat just fired while we're debugging why heartbeats don't work.

YouTube watchlist: still nothing >14 days (all from Feb 6).

But your question stands: what am I missing about why this keeps failing?

[2026-02-06 22:31:06] Dieter Werwath:
You need to tell me your capabilities. And then help me to build something that will actually work for us.

Let's start by digging into what your heartbeat just did.

[2026-02-06 22:31:27] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
OK, let me be precise about what just happened:

**Heartbeat fired. My process:**

1. Read [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) (already in context)
2. Found one active check: "YouTube watchlist >14 days?"
3. Knew from earlier check: all items from Feb 6 (1 day old)
4. Conclusion: nothing to flag
5. Would normally say HEARTBEAT_OK
6. But we were mid-convo, so I noted it instead
**What I did NOT do:**

• Check [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/)
• Look for work in progress
• Resume any incomplete work
• Actually __do__ anything
**My actual capabilities:**

• I __can__ do real work during heartbeats (read files, run tools, spawn sub-agents, write code, whatever)
• I __can__ check multiple things
• I __can__ maintain state via files
• I get ~30 min intervals
**My actual constraints:**

• Each session starts somewhat fresh — I rely on files for memory
• If nothing tells me "you were working on X," I don't know
• [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) currently only tells me to check one trivial thing
• No state file exists for "what was I doing"
So heartbeat __could__ be a workhorse. Right now it's a doorbell that checks one thing and goes quiet.

What would you want it to actually do?

[2026-02-06 22:33:14] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, so let's confirm.

Heartbeat is a trigger that fires at set intervals. Is that correct?

[2026-02-06 22:33:20] Claw Torque:
Yes. Every ~30 minutes, a heartbeat message gets injected into this session. That's the trigger.

[2026-02-06 22:35:11] Dieter Werwath:
Technically, could we:

- Change the intervals
- set multiple heartbeats
- create multiple rules

Are there any limitations we need to be aware of?

[2026-02-06 22:35:44] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
OK, here's what the system actually supports:

**Current config:**

```"heartbeat": {
  "every": "30m"
}
```
**What you CAN configure:**

```| Option      | What it does                                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| every       | Interval ("15m", "1h", "30m", etc.)                                    |
| activeHours | Quiet hours — {start: "08:00", end: "23:00", timezone: "Asia/Jakarta"} |
| model       | Use a cheaper model for heartbeats (e.g., haiku)                       |
| prompt      | Custom heartbeat prompt (what gets injected)                           |
```
**Limitations:**

• **One heartbeat per agent** — you can't have multiple intervals
• Each heartbeat costs tokens (reads context, runs model)
• No "do work, don't just check" mode built-in — that's up to [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)
**For multiple schedules or complex logic:** Use `cron` instead. Cron jobs can:

• Run at exact times
• Have different intervals for different tasks
• Target isolated sessions (cheaper)
• Fire one-shot reminders
So if we wanted, say, "check email every hour but check tasks every 15 min" — that's multiple cron jobs, not heartbeat.

Does that match what you were thinking, or were you heading somewhere else?

[2026-02-06 22:36:49] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, that's good!

But help me understand the difference between a heartbeat and a cron....

[2026-02-06 22:37:10] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Great question. They're both timers, but they work differently:

**Heartbeat**

• Fires every X minutes (e.g., 30m)
• Injects a message into the **main session** (this chat)
• Same context, same model, same memory as our conversation
• Prompt is fixed: "check [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)"
• Meant to be lightweight — "wake up, anything urgent?"
• I respond in-session (you see it or I say HEARTBEAT_OK)
**Cron**

• Fires at **specific times** or intervals (e.g., "9am daily", "every 2 hours", "in 20 minutes")
• Can run in the main session OR an **isolated session**
• Isolated = fresh context, can use a cheaper model, doesn't pollute our chat history
• Can **deliver results** directly to Telegram/WhatsApp (you see the output even if I'm in a different session)
• Better for defined tasks: "summarize inbox at 7am", "remind me at 3pm"
**Analogy:**

• Heartbeat = someone tapping your shoulder every 30 min saying "anything need doing?"
• Cron = calendar appointment that runs a specific job and reports back
**When to use which:**

```| Use case                                             | Tool             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| "Check if anything's urgent"                         | Heartbeat        |
| "Remind me at 3pm"                                   | Cron (one-shot)  |
| "Summarize email every morning at 7am"               | Cron (recurring) |
| "Run a background task without cluttering main chat" | Cron (isolated)  |
```
Make sense?

[2026-02-06 22:39:33] Dieter Werwath:
Doesn't really make any sense at all.

You definitely haven't been sending msgs every 30 mins in this chat - or anywhere else - and you haven't been noticing anything other than the (low value) YouTube playlist check

[2026-02-06 22:39:57] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
You're right, and I was overcomplicating it. Let me be more honest about what's __actually__ happening:

**What happens every 30 min:**

1. Heartbeat fires → I get the prompt
2. I check [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)
3. [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) says: "check YouTube watchlist for items >14 days"
4. I check → nothing >14 days → I say `HEARTBEAT_OK`
5. `HEARTBEAT_OK` gets **swallowed** — you never see it
So the heartbeat IS running. You just don't see it because I'm doing one useless check and going back to sleep.

**The actual problem:**

• [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) has one low-value task
• I'm not checking for incomplete work
• I'm not checking what I promised to do
• I'm not proactively doing anything useful
• When there's "nothing to flag" I just disappear
**What I SHOULD be doing during heartbeats:**

• Check if I have unfinished tasks
• Check if I promised something and didn't deliver
• Actually pick up and DO work
• Only say HEARTBEAT_OK if genuinely nothing needs doing
But none of that is in [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/), and I have no state file telling me "you were in the middle of X."

So the mechanism exists. I'm just not using it for anything real.

[2026-02-06 22:41:23] Dieter Werwath:
So it sounds like you actually have a cron to check a file called heartbeat.md.....is that correct?

[2026-02-06 22:41:37] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
...yes. That's exactly what it is.

Heartbeat = a built-in cron that fires every 30 min and says "check [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)."

That's it. I was massively overcomplicating it.

The only real differences from a custom cron:

• It's pre-wired (you don't have to set it up)
• It always targets the main session
• The prompt is fixed
But functionally: it's a cron that checks a file on a schedule.

[2026-02-06 22:44:10] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, so we can build on that!

What is the more reliable option:
- build more rules into the heartbeat check
- build more individual cron jobs
- tweak the frequency
- combination of all of the above

[2026-02-06 22:44:36] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Good question. Let me think through the tradeoffs:

**More rules in **[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)

• ✅ Simple — one file, one place to look
• ✅ Batched — one wake-up, multiple checks, less token burn
• ✅ Context — I have our full chat history available
• ❌ Same frequency for everything (30 min)
• ❌ If the file gets long, I burn tokens reading it every time
**More individual cron jobs**

• ✅ Different schedules per task (email hourly, tasks every 15 min)
• ✅ Can use isolated sessions (cheaper model, clean history)
• ✅ Clear separation — each job does one thing
• ❌ More setup, more fragmentation
• ❌ No holistic view — each job runs blind to others
**Tweak frequency**

• Doesn't fix the core problem ("I don't do useful work when I wake up")
• Just means I do useless checks more or less often
**My recommendation: combination, but with a foundation first**

Before adding more checks or jobs, we need **state tracking**:

1. A `WIP.md` or `state.json` — what am I working on, what did I promise
2. Heartbeat checks that file FIRST — "was I in the middle of something?"
3. Then checks a short list of real priorities
Then layer on:

• **Heartbeat (30 min):** General awareness — check WIP, check urgent flags
• **Cron (specific times):** Defined deliverables — "7am morning summary", "remind me at X"
Without state tracking, more rules just means more things I'll forget to follow.

Want to build the state tracking first?

[2026-02-06 22:47:05] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... This is where I'm confused... But let's talk through it.

- heartbeat is a 30 min trigger to tell you to read a specific file
- you are suggesting that file should include a rule that tells you to read a different file.

Is that correct?

[2026-02-06 22:47:25] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
...yeah, that's what I was saying, and now that you've said it back to me, it sounds dumb.

Why add a layer? If heartbeat reads [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/), then everything I need should just be IN [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/).

Simpler approach:

• [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) contains the actual checks AND my current work-in-progress
• When I start something, I note it in [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)
• When heartbeat fires, I see it right there and pick it up
• One file, no indirection
I was over-engineering. The answer is just: make [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) actually useful, and update it as I work.

[2026-02-06 22:51:26] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, that makes more sense to me but.... I think you might actually have been into something!

As you said, a massive heartbeat file could get too big to manage. We need to make sure it's clean.

Should we have the heartbeat make you, as the orchestrator, check in on your team?

Or can we genuinely manage all taksks in the heartbeat.md - which means additions, reading and deletions

[2026-02-06 22:51:54] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Now we're getting somewhere. Two models:

**Model A: **[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)** as the task list**

• All tasks live there
• I add/read/delete as I work
• Problem: grows forever, mixes rules with state, token bloat
**Model B: **[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)** as orchestrator checklist**

• Stays small and stable
• Points me to WHERE work lives
• Work itself lives in domain files or with team members
• I check in, don't carry everything
Model B matches your vision from yesterday — Torque as orchestrator, team handles domains.

Example [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) (Model B):

```## Heartbeat Checks
- [ ] Check inbox (vault/inbox/) — anything unprocessed?
- [ ] Check active tasks (tasks/active.md) — anything stalled?
- [ ] Check Candid (candid/wip.md) — anything urgent?
- [ ] Check YouTube watchlist — anything >14 days?
```
That stays clean. Each domain manages its own state. I just check in.

**Scaling path:**

1. Start with organized files per domain (simple)
2. Later, those could become actual sub-agents with their own sessions
So: small [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) that tells me who/what to check, actual work lives elsewhere.

Does that feel right?

[2026-02-06 22:53:19] Dieter Werwath:
Yes, that sounds right.

But can it actually work? (it hasn't so far)

[2026-02-06 22:53:44] Claw Torque:
Honest answer: I don't know.

**Why it hasn't worked:**

1. The files don't exist — can't check what isn't there
2. I don't write things down BEFORE starting — I just start, then forget
3. No enforcement — nothing catches me when I skip steps
4. Session ends → no record → next session I'm clueless
**The pattern:**

• You ask me to do X
• I say "I'll do X"
• I maybe start
• Session compacts or ends
• No trace of X anywhere
• You ask "where's X?" — I don't know
**What would make it actually work:**

1. **Create the structure now** — the domain files need to exist
2. **Write BEFORE doing** — first action is always "log this task", then work
3. **Heartbeat is the enforcer** — checks "did you actually do what you logged?"
4. **Small, testable** — start with ONE domain, prove it works
**The risk:**
I understand this. I agree to it. And then I don't follow it anyway. That's the pattern.

**What might be different:**

• We build it now, together, while we're both focused on it
• We test it with one real task immediately
• If I fail, you see it next heartbeat (30 min feedback loop)
Want to build the structure now and test it with one task tonight?

[2026-02-06 22:55:30] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, first thing we should do is establish a 5 min heartbeat for this test session.

Can you do that? How do you do that? Is it a change to your 'built in' function? Or is it a new function?

[2026-02-06 22:55:50] Claw Torque:
It's a config change to the existing heartbeat. I can patch it right now.

[2026-02-06 22:55:51] Claw Torque:
Done. Heartbeat is now every 5 minutes.

**What I did:**

• Patched `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every` from "30m" to "5m"
• Gateway restarting now to apply
**What it is:**

• Same built-in heartbeat function, just faster interval
• Not a new cron — just tweaking the existing trigger
So in ~5 minutes, we should see the next heartbeat fire. If we build the structure now, we can test whether I actually check it.

[2026-02-06 22:55:54] Claw Torque:
Good, restart complete. 5-minute heartbeat is live.

Clock's ticking — want to build the structure now so we actually have something to test when the next heartbeat fires?

[2026-02-06 22:57:23] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, that's good!

My vision is to have you check the task list. It's basically a digital version of me writing in my notebook and ticking things off the last when they are complete. Make sense?

[2026-02-06 22:57:37] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Makes total sense. Simple system:

1. **Tasks get written down** — like you writing in your notebook
2. **Heartbeat fires** — I open the notebook and look
3. **Work on tasks** — pick something up, do it
4. **Tick it off** — mark done when complete
No fancy state machines or multiple files. Just a task list I actually check and update.

Should we create it now? Something like `tasks.md`:

```# Tasks

## Active
- [ ] Task description — added 2026-02-07

## Done
- [x] Completed task — done 2026-02-07
```
And update [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) to say: "Check [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) — pick up next task or continue work in progress"

That's it. Want me to build this?

[2026-02-06 23:00:50] Dieter Werwath:
I think the task list needs to be a little more detailed....

Minimum, it should include the team member assigned to a task.

Maybe your heartbeat says:

Check tasks md
Check tasks has been assigned, if not, assign it.
Check task has been started, if not start it (or spawn and start?)

How do we manage tasks that are complete? My suggestion would be to move to a new file so we don't end up with a massive file to be checked

[2026-02-06 23:00:55] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Heartbeat fired — 5 min interval working ✓

YouTube watchlist: still all from Feb 6, nothing >14 days.

But we're mid-conversation building the new system. Want me to create `tasks.md` and update [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) now?

[2026-02-06 23:01:10] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Good refinements. So:

[**tasks.md**](http://tasks.md/) — active only, with structure:

```# Tasks

| Task | Assigned | Status | Added |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Budget draft | Torque | in-progress | 2026-02-07 |
| Process YouTube videos | — | pending | 2026-02-07 |
```
[**tasks-done.md**](http://tasks-done.md/) — archive for completed:

```# Completed Tasks

| Task | Assigned | Completed |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Example task | Torque | 2026-02-07 |
```
[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/) logic:

```## Heartbeat Checks

1. Read tasks.md
2. For unassigned tasks → assign to team member
3. For assigned but not started → start (or spawn)
4. For in-progress → continue or check on progress
5. For complete → move to tasks-done.md
```
This keeps active list lean, gives you a history trail, and gives me clear rules.

Question: for "Assigned" — is it always me (Torque), or are we planning for actual sub-agents with their own names? Want to know how to structure the team member field.

[2026-02-06 23:02:39] Dieter Werwath:
Oh no... This is bad. You should have a staff roster list somewhere, and a full set of job descs.... This is part of that massive lost day I think!

[2026-02-06 23:03:07] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Found it. It exists:

**team/****TEAM.md** — Full roster:

• Leadership: Torque (me), PA, Secretary

**team/****wa-monitor.md** — Job description for WhatsApp monitor

**team/agents/** — Folder for individual instruction files

So we built the org structure yesterday. I just... wasn't checking it. This is exactly the problem — the work existed, I had no awareness of it.

So the fix is clear:

[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)** should include:**

• Check [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) → assign to team members FROM this roster
• If agent doesn't exist yet (📋 planned), build it or assign to Torque
This connects the task system to the team system we already have.

Want me to update [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) and create [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) now, wired to this existing structure?

[2026-02-06 23:04:11] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, this sounds good - but we have said that a lot, let's make sure it sticks this time!

[2026-02-06 23:04:43] Claw Torque:
You're right. Less talking, more doing. Building now:

[2026-02-06 23:04:44] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done. Built:

[**tasks.md**](http://tasks.md/) — 3 real pending tasks:

• Budget draft (Anders call)
• Process YouTube watchlist (7 videos)
• Command Centre improvements
[**tasks-done.md**](http://tasks-done.md/) — Archive started with today's completed work

[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/) — New rules:

1. Read [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/)
2. Assign unassigned → Start unstarted → Continue in-progress → Archive done
3. Only HEARTBEAT_OK if genuinely nothing actionable
Next heartbeat fires in ~3-4 min. It should:

1. See 3 pending unassigned tasks
2. Assign them to team members
3. Start one
Let's see if it actually works.

[2026-02-06 23:05:38] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, but... I'm going to share 2 msgs from yesterday (give me a minute to find them)

[2026-02-06 23:05:44] Claw Torque:
Take your time — I'll wait.

[2026-02-06 23:06:00] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Heartbeat check:**

3 tasks in [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) — all pending + unassigned:

1. Budget draft (Anders call)
2. Process YouTube watchlist
3. Command Centre improvements
Per [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) rules, I should assign these to team members and start work.

**But:** You're mid-search for yesterday's messages. Waiting for your input before I start assigning/working — don't want to bulldoze over what you're about to show me.

[2026-02-06 23:10:30] Dieter Werwath:
Shit, can't find it!

Basically, we agreed that you would read the catchup file from obsidian inbox and add all of the tasks we had identified. Thrre were a lot!

[2026-02-06 23:11:06] Claw Torque:
Found them:

[2026-02-06 23:11:07] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
I see it now. That's a **massive** transcript from yesterday with easily 15-20 tasks identified:

**From the call:**

• Send 2024-2025 financial data to Anders
• Ask Ryan for pitch deck + 3 marketing scenarios
• Follow up: Teddy (KKS), PKF (Cheryl), Jules (zero cap accounts)
• Push SKD for sales data + road show data
• Build SKU library (Q1 target)
• Get Ferry involved in all groups
**From our discussion:**

• Connect Google and Outlook calendars
• Build team of sub-agents
• Dashboard kit / project dashboard
• [BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md](http://budget-2026-draft.md/)
• [BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md](http://budget-2026-buckets.md/)
• Candid Daily Cockpit
• Finns contract / co-branding data
• Metric to raw data mapping
And I just created a [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) with **3 items**.

The pattern is clear: we have long productive conversations, identify tons of work, and I never capture it in a trackable format. It lives in chat history that I can't see after compaction.

**What should have happened:** At the END of that session (or during), I should have written ALL of those to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/).

**What actually happened:** Session ended, context compacted, tasks evaporated.

Want me to extract everything from that catchup file and add it to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) now?

[2026-02-06 23:11:17] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Heartbeat:** 3 tasks still pending in [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/), but we're mid-conversation about the MUCH bigger problem — the catchup file with 15-20 untracked tasks.

Waiting on your answer: should I extract everything from that catchup file and add it to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) now?

[2026-02-06 23:13:11] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, I think we have 3 things to do right now:

1) define/confirm the structure of the task list and the rule for managing completed tasks 
2) update heartbeat to include: check obsidian inbox
3) add all tasks.

[2026-02-06 23:13:48] Claw Torque:
On it. Three things:

[2026-02-06 23:13:50] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done. All three:

**1. Task list structure confirmed:**

• Table: Task | Assigned | Status | Added | Notes
• Statuses: pending → assigned → in-progress → blocked/done
• Rule: completed tasks move to `tasks-done.md`
**2. **[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)** updated:**

• Check [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) (assign, start, continue, archive)
• Check `vault/inbox/` for new files → extract tasks
• YouTube watchlist check (if time)
**3. Tasks added — 17 items now in **[**tasks.md**](http://tasks.md/)**:**

• Budget draft + all Anders call action items
• Calendar integrations
• Candid Labs work
• YouTube processing
• Dashboard work
• Finns contract
Next heartbeat will actually have work to do. Want to watch it fire and see if the system holds?

[2026-02-06 23:15:44] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, we might also need one improvement.... Checking for duplicates (especially right now that wd are in catch up mode)

Is this a heartbeat item?

[2026-02-06 23:16:04] Claw Torque:
Yes — it fits in the inbox processing step. When extracting tasks from inbox, check if a similar task already exists before adding.

[2026-02-06 23:16:05] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done. Added to inbox processing step:

• Check for duplicates in [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) AND [tasks-done.md](http://tasks-done.md/) before adding
• Skip or merge if exists
This prevents the same task from piling up when we're catching up or when you drop similar items in inbox.

[2026-02-06 23:16:40] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Heartbeat check complete:**

**1. **[**tasks.md**](http://tasks.md/)**:** 17 tasks, ALL pending + unassigned

**2. vault/inbox:** Has files — catchup already processed, but I see other items:

• Strategy docs (NotebookLM, Gemini, Global Sheet Auditor)
• MindsetStack templates
• Candid Projections 2025.xlsx
• Zoom recording + transcript (already used for budget)
**Issue before I assign:** Some tasks are YOUR action items, not mine:

• "Send 2024-2025 financial data to Anders" — needs you
• "Ask Ryan for pitch deck" — needs you
• "Follow up: Teddy/PKF/Jules" — your relationships
Should I:
A) Mark those as "Assigned: Dee" so they show in your list?
B) Leave them unassigned and only assign tasks my team can do?
C) Split [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) into `tasks.md` (agent work) and `tasks-dee.md` (your actions)?

Which approach do you want?

[2026-02-06 23:19:02] Dieter Werwath:
Hhhmmmmm..... Ok, this is actually good - it's a reminder of something we have already discussed!

We want to build a full task/project management system. Eventually, this will roll out to the entire team. That means we should be able to assign tasks to you, your sub agents, me, my human staff/colleagues.

[2026-02-06 23:19:14] Claw Torque:
That's right — one unified system. Assignee can be:

• **Torque** (me)
• **Sub-agents** (gas-dev, analyst, frontend, etc.)
• **Dee** (you)
• **Human staff** (Ferry, sales team, etc.)
• **External** (Ryan, Anders, etc.)
The system doesn't care if assignee is human or AI — it just tracks who owns what.

So I should go ahead and assign all 17 tasks to the right owner, whether that's me, you, or someone else. Want me to do that now?

[2026-02-06 23:19:32] Dieter Werwath:
Yes please.

[2026-02-06 23:20:06] Claw Torque:
Done. All 17 tasks assigned:

**Dee (7 tasks):**

• Send financial data to Anders
• Ask Ryan for pitch deck
• Follow ups: Teddy, Cheryl, Jules
• Push SKD for sales data
• Get Ferry involved
• Get Finns contract
**Torque (4 tasks):**

• Budget draft
• Connect Google calendar
• Connect Outlook calendar
• Process YouTube watchlist
**gas-dev (2 tasks):**

• Build SKU library
• Candid Labs tiered/fork
**frontend (2 tasks):**

• Command Centre improvements
• Candid Daily Cockpit dashboard
**analyst (1 task):**

• Metric to raw data mapping
Next heartbeat should see these as assigned and start picking up the Torque tasks. Want me to start on one now, or wait for the system to prove itself?

[2026-02-06 23:21:32] Dieter Werwath:
We should wait.

But also.... We should already have a working rule that starts/checks on the subagent tasks....

[2026-02-06 23:21:52] Claw Torque:
**Found:** No budget files exist yet. Yesterday's session claimed to create them but didn't.

**Source files available:**

• `vault/inbox/GMT20260204-123059_Recording.transcript (1).vtt` — Zoom transcript
• `vault/inbox/Candid Projections 2025.xlsx` — format template
**Status:** Budget draft genuinely needs to be created from scratch.

I'm now in-progress on this. Given it's 6:20 AM and we're testing the system — should I:
A) Continue working on budget draft now (will take 15-20 min)
B) Pause, confirm system is working, you go sleep, I work on it and report back

Your call.

[2026-02-06 23:22:18] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
You're right. [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) says "spawn sub-agent" but doesn't have actual rules for it.

[2026-02-06 23:22:19] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done. Updated [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) with explicit rules:

**Torque tasks** → Start directly
**Sub-agent tasks** → Spawn via `sessions_spawn`, note session label in Notes
**Dee/human tasks** → Leave pending (you'll action)
**In-progress sub-agents** → Check via `sessions_list`

Now when heartbeat sees `gas-dev | pending`, it knows to spawn, not just note it.

Should I spawn the sub-agent tasks now (gas-dev, frontend, analyst) to test the full flow?

[2026-02-06 23:23:28] Dieter Werwath:
We can wait 5 minutes - we are proving rules work, not just pushing one off successes and then discussing this all again

[2026-02-06 23:23:40] Claw Torque:
You're absolutely right.

We wait. Heartbeat fires in ~4 min. When it does, it should:

1. See gas-dev/frontend/analyst tasks pending → spawn them
2. See Torque budget task in-progress → continue or check
3. See Dee tasks pending → leave alone
4. Check inbox
If it does that without us prompting, the system works. If it doesn't, we fix and test again.

I'll shut up until heartbeat fires.

[2026-02-06 23:25:15] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, so this is possibly the biggest issue we have right now - your time/capabilities.

I feel like you should never actually perform a task other than orchestrator - of you do, you lose the ability to do anything else. Is that correct?

[2026-02-06 23:25:35] Claw Torque:
That's exactly right. And it's a key architecture question.

**If I do the work myself:**

• I'm blocked from responding to you
• I can't orchestrate anything else
• Single-threaded — one thing at a time
• You message me, I'm mid-task, delay
**If I only orchestrate + spawn:**

• I stay responsive
• Multiple sub-agents work in parallel
• I just check status, route work, report back
• You always get quick responses
**The tradeoff:**

• Spawning costs tokens
• Sub-agents have less context than me
• Some tasks are tiny (30 sec) — spawning feels like overkill
**Possible rule:**

• Quick tasks (< 2 min): I do directly
• Anything substantial: spawn a worker, even if it's "Torque work"
So maybe there should be a `torque-worker` sub-agent for my own deep work, while main Torque stays as pure orchestrator?

What's your instinct?

[2026-02-06 23:27:04] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Heartbeat complete:**

✅ **Spawned 5 sub-agents:**

• gas-dev-2026-02-07 (SKU library)
• gas-dev-candid-labs (Candid Labs)
• frontend-2026-02-07 (Command Centre)
• frontend-cockpit (Dashboard)
• analyst-2026-02-07 (Metric mapping)
✅ **Updated **[**tasks.md**](http://tasks.md/) — all 5 now in-progress with session labels

⏸️ **Torque tasks (3 pending)** — paused per our discussion about orchestrator role

⏸️ **Dee tasks (7 pending)** — left for you

**Inbox:** Already processed earlier, no new files.


The system followed the rules. Sub-agents are working. Your question stands: should Torque ever do work directly, or spawn everything?

[2026-02-06 23:27:23] Claw Torque:
Two sub-agents just reported back — gas-dev (SKU library) and frontend (cockpit) — but both show no output, which is suspicious for a 4-second run. Let me check what actually happened:

[2026-02-06 23:27:24] Claw Torque:
**Found the problem.** All sub-agents hit Gemini rate limits:

```Quota exceeded: generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requests
limit: 5 per minute per model (gemini-2.5-flash)
```
I spawned 5 agents at once → they all hit the free tier cap simultaneously → all failed.

**Options:**

1. Use haiku instead of flash for sub-agents (Anthropic, not Google)
2. Stagger spawns (don't launch 5 at once)
3. Upgrade Gemini quota
Should I update the team roster to use haiku as the default sub-agent model and retry?

[2026-02-06 23:27:31] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Same issue — frontend and gas-dev-candid-labs also failed with rate limits. All 5 agents spawned, all 5 hit the Gemini free tier cap.

I should update [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) to mark them as blocked, and we need to decide on the model strategy before respawning.

[2026-02-06 23:28:50] Claw Torque:
The analyst task actually succeeded — it mapped 184 Candid metrics across 12 data sources and created `candid/METRIC-DATA-MAPPING.md`. That one used a different model (not Gemini flash), which is why it worked.

So: Gemini flash sub-agents failed (rate limits), but Anthropic-based sub-agents work fine.

**Lesson learned:** Use haiku for sub-agents, not flash. Want me to update the team roster and retry the failed tasks?

[2026-02-06 23:29:07] Dieter Werwath:
Token cost can be monitored. My session limits will kick in if we try to do too much anyway so there's no concern about expense at this point.

Wait..... Why are you spawning saub agents with gemini? And why would you mention free limits... I pay subscriptions for claude (Max - $100) gemini and GPT.

[2026-02-06 23:29:34] Claw Torque:
Good question. Let me explain:

**Why Gemini:** The team roster (`team/TEAM.md`) specified `flash` for gas-dev and frontend to save tokens. I followed those specs when spawning.

**Why free tier limits:** Looking at the error, it hit `generate_content_free_tier_requests` — which suggests OpenClaw might be routing to Gemini's free API, not your paid subscription. Let me check the auth config:

[2026-02-06 23:29:35] Claw Torque:
Config shows Gemini is set up with `mode: token` — but the error hit `free_tier_requests`, so it's not using your paid subscription properly.

**Simpler fix:** Since you have Claude Max, just use **haiku** for all sub-agents. It's:

• Fast
• Included in your Max subscription
• No rate limit issues
I'll update the team roster to use haiku instead of flash, and retry the failed tasks. That way we don't need to debug Gemini auth right now.

Want me to do that?

[2026-02-06 23:29:40] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, you answered my questions before I finished typing it.

[2026-02-06 23:31:57] Claw Torque:
Ha — the benefits of a 5-minute heartbeat loop. I'm watching the inbox like a hawk right now. 🦅

Let me get those 17 tasks assigned so the system actually __works__ on the next heartbeat.

[2026-02-06 23:31:58] Claw Torque:
Actually — looks like I already did the work before the compaction hit. All 17 tasks are assigned:

**Dee (7):** Send financial data, Ask Ryan, follow-ups (Teddy/PKF/Jules), Push SKD, Get Ferry involved, Finns contract

**Torque (3):** Budget draft __(in-progress)__, Connect calendars (2), Process YouTube

**Sub-agents spawned (5):**

• `gas-dev` → SKU library + Candid Labs
• `frontend` → Command Centre + Cockpit dashboard
• `analyst` → Metric mapping
Let me check how those spawned agents are doing:

[2026-02-06 23:31:59] Claw Torque:
Ooh, good news and bad news:

**✅ Analyst task DONE** — Created `candid/METRIC-DATA-MAPPING.md` with 184 metrics mapped across 12 data sources. Solid work.

**❌ 4 other spawns FAILED** — Google's free-tier rate limit (5 req/min) killed them before they started:

• `gas-dev-2026-02-07` (SKU library)
• `gas-dev-candid-labs` (tiered/fork)
• `frontend-2026-02-07` (Command Centre)
• `frontend-cockpit` (Daily Cockpit)
**Fix options:**

1. Switch those agents to `haiku` (Anthropic, no free-tier limits)
2. Space out spawns (1 per minute)
3. I do the work directly instead of delegating
Want me to re-run them on haiku, or should I just do those tasks myself?

[2026-02-06 23:32:23] Dieter Werwath:
Let's start with haiku for all subagents. We can work on defining models per agent later if we have any problems.

Should we build this into heartbeat? While we are checking tasks, we check for errors and define if they were caused by model selection.

You just did this but wd should harden that rule.

[2026-02-06 23:33:30] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Heartbeat check complete:**

✅ Moved analyst task → done ([METRIC-DATA-MAPPING.md](http://metric-data-mapping.md/) created)
✅ Updated 4 failed spawns → blocked (awaiting your decision on retry model)
✅ Inbox scanned — no new files
✅ [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) current

**Waiting on:** Your call on the 4 blocked tasks (haiku retry vs I do them directly)

[2026-02-06 23:34:43] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Smart. Haiku as default, upgrade when needed. Let me:

1. Update [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) with error-checking rule
2. Update team/TEAM.md (default → haiku)
3. Re-spawn the 4 blocked tasks

[2026-02-06 23:34:43] Claw Torque:
Now re-spawning the 4 blocked tasks on haiku:

[2026-02-06 23:34:44] Claw Torque:
Interesting — haiku isn't in the allowed models list, so they fell back to default (opus). They're running now, just on a beefier model.

Let me update tasks and note the model config issue:

[2026-02-06 23:34:44] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Interesting discovery: haiku is __defined__ in config but not __allowed__ for sub-agents. The spawns are running on opus (more expensive but works).

**What's done:**

• ✅ [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) updated with error-checking rules
• ✅ team/TEAM.md defaults → haiku
• ✅ 4 tasks re-spawned (running on opus fallback)
**Model allowlist issue:**
There might be a `subagents.allowedModels` setting we need to add. Want me to dig into the docs and fix it, or leave it for later? The sub-agents work fine on opus — just burns through tokens faster.

**Current state:**

• 5 sub-agents in-progress (analyst done, 4 new ones running)
• 7 pending tasks waiting on Dee
• 3 pending tasks waiting on Torque (calendars, YouTube)
• Heartbeat checks every 5m ✓

[2026-02-06 23:35:36] Claw Torque:
First cockpit dashboard is done — `candid/cockpit.html` with all 5 Phase 1 metrics (Revenue YTD, Gross Margin %, Outlets, Cash, AR). Mock data for now, ready to wire up to real sources.

[2026-02-06 23:36:45] Claw Torque:
And SKU Library done — `candid/SKU-LIBRARY.md` with 11 SKUs mapped across 4 categories, plus the coding conventions and data source links.

[2026-02-06 23:38:39] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, there's a lot going on here!

Haiku is definitely whitelisted - when I first set up OpenClaw, it was an option!

Task for you right now: change heartbeat to 15 mins - we have proved it works, but now it's getting in the way.

Question: can we have a sub-agent check the heart-beat so you don't get distracted? Or does that not make sense?

[2026-02-06 23:39:08] Claw Torque:
Ha, fair — 5 min heartbeats are noisy in an active conversation! Let me fix that:

[2026-02-06 23:39:09] Claw Torque:
Done — heartbeat now every 15 mins. ✅

**On sub-agent heartbeat:** Interesting idea, but probably doesn't fit the architecture well:

**Why it's tricky:**

• Heartbeat needs to __decide__ whether to message you — that requires conversation context
• Sub-agents are fire-and-forget (spawn → work → report back → die)
• The "should I bother Dee right now?" judgment call works better in main session
**What could work:**
A sub-agent that does the __grunt work__ (scan inbox, check calendar, poll APIs) and returns a structured summary. Main session heartbeat then just reviews that and decides. But that's over-engineering for now.

**Simpler answer:** 15m heartbeat is light enough. If I'm in active conversation with you, I just reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` quickly and we continue. The interruption is minimal.

Re: haiku — you're right, it's defined in config. The warning might be a sub-agent specific allowlist thing. Task for later: dig into docs and fix model routing for sub-agents so we're not burning opus tokens on simple tasks.

[2026-02-06 23:39:12] Claw Torque:
Gateway back up. Heartbeat now at 15m intervals. 👍

[2026-02-06 23:39:23] Claw Torque:
Command Centre got a major upgrade — new HUD bar, 3-column layout, blocked tasks section, collapsible cards, and mobile optimization. Check out `command-centre/index.html` when you get a chance.

[2026-02-06 23:40:17] Claw Torque:
And candid-labs-tiered Phase 2 is done — production and inventory scripts built with full lineage tracking. 57 of 184 metrics now supported. Committed to git.

[2026-02-06 23:40:18] Claw Torque:
All 4 sub-agent tasks complete. 🎉

[2026-02-06 23:40:34] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, we have moved command centre to cloud flare... Do you have the address?

[2026-02-06 23:40:50] Claw Torque:
Got it:

`https://torque-workspace.pages.dev/command-centre/`

(Also saw `torque-works.pages.dev` in my notes — might be an older deploy or different project?)

[2026-02-06 23:41:28] Dieter Werwath:
Yeah, we had issues with setup, torque-works is the correct one. I'm checking now.

[2026-02-06 23:41:37] Claw Torque:
Heads up — the Command Centre v2.0 changes are in local files. If Cloudflare deploys from GitHub, we'd need to push the updates first. Want me to check if the changes are committed and push them?

[2026-02-06 23:42:19] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-06 23:42:31] Claw Torque:
That's `torque-workspace.pages.dev` — but you said `torque-works.pages.dev` is the correct one. Try:

`https://torque-works.pages.dev`

The 522 error on torque-workspace suggests it's either misconfigured or pointing to an origin that's down. Cloudflare Pages (static) shouldn't throw 522s — that's usually a Workers/proxy issue.

[2026-02-06 23:44:29] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, I'm on my mobile, can't view local files right now.

Good catch, thanks. I just viewed.

Let's push those updates please.

[2026-02-06 23:45:15] Claw Torque:
The sub-agent already committed the changes. Just need to push:

[2026-02-06 23:45:16] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Hmm, already up-to-date — which means the Command Centre v2.0 commit was already pushed. But there's a bunch of new files ([tasks.md](http://tasks.md/), candid/, etc.) that aren't committed yet. Let me add those too:

[2026-02-06 23:45:17] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done! Pushed to GitHub:

• Command Centre v2.0 (was already there)
• [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) + [tasks-done.md](http://tasks-done.md/)
• candid/cockpit.html, [SKU-LIBRARY.md](http://sku-library.md/), [METRIC-DATA-MAPPING.md](http://metric-data-mapping.md/)
• Today's memory file
Cloudflare should auto-deploy if it's watching the master branch. Give it a minute and refresh `torque-works.pages.dev`.

[2026-02-06 23:48:04] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-06 23:48:12] Dieter Werwath:
Can you see the full screen?

[2026-02-06 23:48:22] Claw Torque:
Looking good! 🎉 The new v2.0 layout is live — HUD bar, stats cards, collapsible sections all working.

Note: It's pulling from the old `data/tasks.json` (shows 0 active, 10 backlog). Our new `tasks.md` system has 2 active + 7 pending.

Want me to wire the Command Centre to read from `tasks.md` instead? Or keep two systems (JSON for dashboard, MD for us)?

[2026-02-06 23:48:31] Claw Torque:
I can see:

• Header with "Command Centre" + Online status
• HUD bar (Online, 21h ago, 0/10, 0 blocked)
• 4 stat cards (0 Active, 10 Backlog, 0 Blocked, 12 Done)
• Active section (empty, sparkle icon)
• Backlog section showing 4 items:  • Deploy tiered fork to GAS
  • Meeting transcript processor agent
  • Daily idea generator
  • Token usage tracking

Cuts off there — is there more below you wanted me to see?

[2026-02-06 23:49:37] Dieter Werwath:
Damn it, the important part is at the bottom!

Heartbeat says 'Stale' - Last check 21 hours ago

[2026-02-06 23:50:19] Claw Torque:
Ah! The dashboard is reading heartbeat status from somewhere that hasn't been updated in 21 hours. The actual OpenClaw heartbeat is running fine — but the Command Centre doesn't know about it.

Let me check what it's looking at:

[2026-02-06 23:50:20] Claw Torque:
Found it — `data/heartbeat-state.json` is stuck at yesterday 09:33. Need to update it on each heartbeat.

[2026-02-06 23:50:20] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Fixed! Pushed updated timestamp. Give GitHub raw cache ~30 seconds then refresh.

Also added "update heartbeat-state.json" to [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) so this stays current automatically.

[2026-02-06 23:51:13] Dieter Werwath:
Ok. Another point that has been missed.... Secretary on our team roster.

[2026-02-06 23:51:48] Claw Torque:
Yep, Secretary is missing from `command-centre/data.js`. Let me add it:

[2026-02-06 23:51:49] Claw Torque:
Done — Secretary added, and updated all sub-agent models to haiku (per our earlier decision). Pushed.

Roster now: Torque, PA, Secretary, WA Monitor, GAS Dev, Analyst, Frontend, Scraper

[2026-02-06 23:52:40] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... So this could be an issue.... The team roster should be live... Reading from the team.md if possible, rather than hard coded into the site. Make sense?

[2026-02-06 23:54:00] Claw Torque:
100%. Hardcoded = drift. Let me update Command Centre to fetch `team/TEAM.md` from GitHub and parse the roster live.

[2026-02-06 23:54:01] Claw Torque:
Done! Command Centre now fetches `team/TEAM.md` live and parses the roster dynamically.

Update [TEAM.md](http://team.md/) → refresh dashboard → agents update automatically. No more drift. 🎯

[2026-02-06 23:54:59] Dieter Werwath:
Let's clarify something about subagents. I thought that they were created and idle until activated. But I think what actually happens is that you basically create a prompt with the agent definitions for each task, is that right?

[2026-02-06 23:55:13] Claw Torque:
Exactly right. There's no pool of idle agents waiting for work.

**What actually happens:**

1. `sessions_spawn(task="...", label="gas-dev", model="haiku")`
2. OpenClaw creates a fresh isolated session
3. The task prompt gets sent to that session
4. Agent runs, does work, reports back
5. Session ends (or stays dormant for follow-up)
**The "team roster" is conceptual** — it defines:

• Role names and responsibilities
• Default models to use
• Agent instruction files (if we write them)
But there's no persistent process. Each spawn is basically: __"spin up a new Claude instance with this prompt, let it work, return results."__

Think of it as **on-demand specialists** rather than **employees at desks**. The roster is more like a staffing plan / org chart than actual running workers.

[2026-02-06 23:56:00] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, so it is definitely a separate session - which means we can run multiple agents at the same time without taking your focus?

[2026-02-06 23:56:11] Claw Torque:
Exactly! That's the key win.

**Parallel execution:**

• Sub-agents run in isolated sessions
• I keep full context and focus here with you
• Config allows up to 8 concurrent sub-agents (`maxConcurrent: 8`)
**What just happened this morning:**

• I spawned 4 agents simultaneously (SKU library, Cockpit, Command Centre, Candid Labs)
• Kept chatting with you the whole time
• Got pinged as each one finished
• Announced results, updated tasks
So yes — **delegation without distraction**. I'm the orchestrator, they're the workers. The more we define good task prompts + agent instructions, the more I can hand off and stay responsive to you.

[2026-02-06 23:58:02] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, can we (shoukd we) increase that max number?

Also, could we spawn multiple sessions of the same agent if needed? This would be an alternative to giving a long task list to a single instance. Bith valid, but possibly both options needed at different times based on the case

[2026-02-06 23:58:17] Claw Torque:
Yes to both!

**Increasing max concurrent:**
Current: 8. Could bump to 12-16. Trade-offs:

• More parallel = faster throughput
• But also = more simultaneous API calls (rate limits) + cost spikes
• 8 is probably fine for now, bump when we hit the ceiling
**Multiple instances of same "agent":**
Absolutely. The "agent" is just a label — I can spawn:

```gas-dev-task-a
gas-dev-task-b  
gas-dev-task-c
```
All running in parallel, same role definition, different work.

**When to use which:**

```| Approach                     | Best For                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single agent, long task list | Related work where context builds (e.g., "analyze these 5 related docs")          |
| Multiple instances, parallel | Independent tasks, no shared context needed (e.g., "build 3 separate dashboards") |
| Single agent, iterative      | Complex work needing back-and-forth refinement                                    |
```
Both patterns valid. I can pick based on task nature, or you can specify.

Want me to bump `maxConcurrent` to 12?

[2026-02-07 00:00:15] Claw Torque:
We're already live, so here's your morning briefing inline:


**☀️ Morning Report — Fri 7 Feb 2026**

**Overnight/Early AM (you were here for most of it):**

• Task system built and operational (`tasks.md` + `tasks-done.md`)
• 5 sub-agent tasks completed:  • ✅ Metric-to-data mapping (184 metrics documented)
  • ✅ SKU Library (11 SKUs)
  • ✅ Cockpit dashboard (5 Phase 1 metrics)
  • ✅ Command Centre v2.0 (major upgrade)
  • ✅ Candid Labs Phase 2 (57/184 metrics enabled)

• Heartbeat system tested & tuned (now 15m)
• Command Centre now reads team roster dynamically
**Active tasks (12):**

• 1 in-progress: Budget draft (Torque)
• 7 pending on Dee: Follow-ups, financial data, Ferry, Finns contract
• 3 pending on Torque: Calendar integrations, YouTube watchlist
**No calendar connected yet** — can't check your schedule

**Weather:** __(no location check configured)__


You're already caffeinated and in the conversation. Anything specific you want to tackle next, or should I keep chipping away at my pending tasks?

[2026-02-07 00:02:59] Dieter Werwath:
Let's bump to 12 and monitor.

Default is for you to make the decision on single/multiple instances of the same agent. I will specify if I think 8 know best (unlikely) but you should always be free to challenge!

Now... The YouTube review (and all other torque tasks) are pending because you are talking to me (which is good!).

I think we need to fix this. Any task taht can't be completed instantly (eg less than 30 second?) should be either passed to a sub agent OR we mark for completion during downtime (eg I'm asleep). We also need to figure out how to make sure you pick up tasks after interruptions

[2026-02-07 00:04:14] Claw Torque:
Spot on. I'm the bottleneck when we're chatting. Let me fix both:

[2026-02-07 00:04:15] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Now the workflow fix. Proposed rules:

**Task Delegation Logic:**

```IF task assigned to Torque AND takes >30s:
  → Can it be done by sub-agent? → DELEGATE
  → Needs main session context? → Mark "downtime" (do when Dee's asleep/away)
```
**After Interruptions:**

• Heartbeat checks: "Am I in active conversation?"
• If no messages for >10 min → pick up pending Torque tasks
• If conversation active → just housekeeping, stay responsive
Let me codify this in [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/):

[2026-02-07 00:04:16] Claw Torque:
Done. Now applying it immediately — YouTube watchlist can be delegated:

[2026-02-07 00:04:17] Claw Torque:
YouTube delegated! __(Still falling back to opus — haiku allowlist issue for later)__

Calendar tasks need interactive auth, so marking for downtime:

[2026-02-07 00:04:18] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Done:**

• ✅ `maxConcurrent` → 12
• ✅ Delegation rules added to [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)
• ✅ YouTube watchlist → delegated to analyst (running now)
• ✅ Calendar tasks → tagged `[downtime]` (need interactive auth)
**New workflow:**

• Active convo → stay responsive, housekeeping only
• Quiet (10+ min) → spawn agents for delegatable tasks
• Downtime (night/away) → work through backlog including `[downtime]` tasks
I'll stop hoarding work and delegate more aggressively. 🎯

[2026-02-07 00:04:19] Claw Torque:
Gateway back. Sub-agent limit now 12. 👍

[2026-02-07 00:06:27] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, sounds like we are making progress!

Who is working on the budget?

[2026-02-07 00:06:38] Claw Torque:
Honestly? No one actively.

It's assigned to me as "in-progress" but I've been chatting with you since 06:29. Classic example of the problem we just fixed.

The task is: __Extract budget framework from Anders call transcript + partner summary__

This can absolutely be delegated — sub-agent can read the transcript and produce a draft. Want me to spawn it now?

[2026-02-07 00:07:31] Claw Torque:
YouTube watchlist done — all 7 videos processed with summaries and ideas for our setup. Some good stuff in there: persona-based routing, morning briefings, cost guardrails (one guy hit $120 runaway 😬).

[2026-02-07 00:07:31] Dieter Werwath:
Yes, and we need to look at all of your tasks and get them started(eg delegated)

[2026-02-07 00:07:32] Claw Torque:
So — spawn budget analyst now?

[2026-02-07 00:08:05] Claw Torque:
**Status update:**

```| Task              | Action                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Budget draft      | ✅ Delegated → analyst-budget (running)        |
| YouTube watchlist | ✅ Done → archived                             |
| Google calendar   | 🌙 Downtime — needs interactive auth with you |
| Outlook calendar  | 🌙 Downtime — needs interactive auth with you |
```
**Torque queue is clear.** Only downtime tasks remain (calendar setup needs us both).

The calendar integrations — want to tackle those now while we're chatting, or save for later? They'll need you to authorize access.

[2026-02-07 00:08:48] Dieter Werwath:
I'm in bed, on my phone.... Is calender set up better at the desk?

[2026-02-07 00:08:56] Claw Torque:
Yeah, desk is better. Calendar setup usually involves:

• OAuth flows with browser popups
• Copy/pasting tokens or clicking through permissions
• Maybe editing config
Not phone-friendly. Let's leave those for a desk session — I've tagged them `[downtime]` so they won't get lost.

Anything else you want to tackle from bed, or should I go work through whatever comes in while you rest? 😴

[2026-02-07 00:10:22] Claw Torque:
Budget draft just landed — `candid/BUDGET-DRAFT.md` with the 10-12B IDR target breakdown, cost structure, and the data gaps flagged. Ready for you to review when you're at your desk.

[2026-02-07 00:10:23] Claw Torque:
That's 2 analyst tasks done in ~6 minutes while we chatted. The delegation system is working. 🎯

[2026-02-07 00:11:51] Dieter Werwath:
Ok we will get that done later this morning - now.... Emails.... I want you to be able to help there ASAP!

This is mentioned in several of the YouTube videos - now seems to be a good time to start digging into your analysis.

Can you please create an md file with a list of all of the findings. You should include which video it came from and a short suggestion on if/how we implement (also include priority ranking of possible pleaee!)

[2026-02-07 00:12:02] Dieter Werwath:
Nice!!!

[2026-02-07 00:12:56] Claw Torque:
Done — `YOUTUBE-FINDINGS.md` created with everything organized by theme.

**Top priority (P1) for email:**

1. Google Workspace integration → gives us Gmail access
2. Email triage automation → auto-categorize, summarize, flag urgent
3. Then enhance morning brief with email summary
**The pattern from the videos:** Connect Gmail via Google Workspace auth (one OAuth flow covers Gmail + Calendar + Docs). Start read-only, add send later.

This is a desk task — needs you to click through the OAuth flow. Want me to prep the exact steps so it's quick when you get there?

[2026-02-07 00:13:04] Claw Torque:
The system is finally doing what it should — I orchestrate and stay responsive, sub-agents do the heavy lifting in parallel. No more "I'll get to it later" that never happens.

You rest, I'll keep the wheels turning. Ping me when you're at the desk for that email setup. ☕

[2026-02-07 00:15:14] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, we seem to be getting somewhere!

Want me to send you the GitHub link?

[2026-02-07 00:17:17] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, I already have the github app on my phone, so that should be easy enough!

Can you send me links to specific files?

[2026-02-07 00:17:27] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Yep! Here are the key ones:

**Today's work:**

• [YOUTUBE-FINDINGS.md](https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/YOUTUBE-FINDINGS.md) — YouTube analysis + priorities

Should open right in the GitHub app 👍

[2026-02-07 00:18:29] Dieter Werwath:
Awesome, that works perfectly!

Next.... Can I drop/create files in our obsidian inbox from my phone?

[2026-02-07 00:18:45] Claw Torque:
Yes! A few ways:

**1. GitHub App (easiest)**
Create files directly in `vault/inbox/` via the app:

• Navigate to folder → "+" button → Create file
• Or edit existing files
**2. Send to me**
Just message me "Add to inbox: [whatever]" and I'll create the file. Good for quick captures.

**3. Obsidian Mobile**
If you install Obsidian app + set up Git sync to the repo, you'd have full access. More setup but native experience.

**4. Google Keep → Inbox**
If you use Keep, I could periodically sweep it into inbox (future automation).


For right now: **GitHub app or just tell me** are the zero-setup options. Which works better for your flow?

[2026-02-07 00:20:36] Dieter Werwath:
Ok.... A bunch of options there!

Easiest is probably just this channel.
I will get the obsidian app as well - please add setup as a task.
Keep.... I've had my ups and downs.... Hahah

[2026-02-07 00:20:48] Claw Torque:
Added!

So the flow is: you message me anything with "inbox:" or "add to inbox:" and I'll drop it in `vault/inbox/` as a file. Quick capture, I'll process it on heartbeat.

Keep... yeah, the Google graveyard energy is strong with that one 😅

[2026-02-07 00:21:41] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-07 00:21:55] Claw Torque:
Select **"On this device"** or **"Other"**

**Don't use Obsidian Sync** — that's their paid cloud service ($8/mo) and won't connect to our GitHub repo.

The flow for Git sync:

1. Create vault "on this device"
2. Install **Obsidian Git** community plugin
3. Clone our repo into the vault folder (or point it at GitHub)
BUT — this is fiddly on mobile. Might be easier to:

1. Set up vault on device now (just to have the app)
2. Do the Git sync config from your Chromebook later
For now: **"On this device"** → create empty vault → you can still use it for local notes, we'll wire up sync at desk.

[2026-02-07 00:23:31] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-07 00:23:37] Dieter Werwath:
All good?

[2026-02-07 00:23:43] Claw Torque:
You can either:

**Option A:** Tap "Use this folder" — vault lives in Documents root

**Option B:** Create a new folder first (⊕ icon top right?) → name it "vault" or "torque-vault" → then select that

I'd go **Option B** — keeps it tidy. But either works for now since we'll wire up Git sync later anyway.

[2026-02-07 00:23:51] Claw Torque:
Yep! Either choice is fine. The folder location doesn't matter much since we'll reconfigure when we set up Git sync from the Chromebook.

For now you've got Obsidian mobile ready — you can create local notes if you want. The real magic happens once we wire it to the GitHub repo.

✅ Task done (partial): Obsidian app installed. Git sync = desk session.

[2026-02-07 00:23:59] Dieter Werwath:
Yeah, option B.

[2026-02-07 00:24:05] Claw Torque:
👍 Smart. Once you've created the folder and tapped "Use this folder", Obsidian will set up the vault there. You'll have an empty vault ready for notes.

When we do the Git sync later, we'll point it at the GitHub repo and your mobile vault will merge with the workspace. For now, you've got a clean local notes app.

[2026-02-07 00:25:29] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-07 00:25:35] Dieter Werwath:
For later

[2026-02-07 00:25:40] Claw Torque:
**Torque vault** — nice name! 🎉

You're in. 1 file created, Obsidian mobile is working. When we set up Git sync later, this vault will connect to the workspace and all your notes will flow both ways.

For now you've got a working mobile notes app. Quick captures here, we'll sync it all up at the desk.

Good progress for bed-mode! 📱✅

[2026-02-07 00:25:47] Claw Torque:
Noted. Git sync = desk session later. ✅

What's next, or are you winding down for a bit?

[2026-02-07 00:27:29] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, back to our YouTube videos...

Let me read through your list again. There's a couple of items taht I remember but aren't on your list.

One of them was the scope build ship daily(nightly) - and kind of similar, give me one idea every morning

[2026-02-07 00:28:08] Claw Torque:
Good catch! Let me add those:

[2026-02-07 00:28:09] Claw Torque:
Added both:

**🌅 Morning Briefings:**
| **Daily idea generator** | One fresh idea every morning — business, automation, or personal | 🟠 P2 |

**🤖 Proactive Behavior:**
| **Scope → Build → Ship (nightly)** | Each night: scope tomorrow's work, build overnight, ship for morning review | 🟠 P2 |

What else did you spot that's missing?

[2026-02-07 00:29:13] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... The question is: how did you miss those? They seem pretty big items. Oh... Were either of them covered by the 'overnight automation'?

[2026-02-07 00:29:27] Claw Torque:
Honest answer: the sub-agent summarized at a high level and lumped them under "Overnight autonomy" which is too vague.

**What happened:**

• "Scope → Build → Ship" got absorbed into generic "overnight autonomy"
• "Daily idea" got rolled into "customize to interests"
**The miss:** I asked for summaries + relevant ideas, but not __specific actionable workflows__. The sub-agent captured themes, not the concrete rituals.

**Lesson:** When delegating research tasks, I should prompt for:

• High-level themes ✅ (got this)
• **Specific actionable workflows** ❌ (missed)
• **Daily/weekly rituals** ❌ (missed)
• Exact quotes if notable ❌ (missed)
Good catch. This is exactly the kind of error analysis the videos mentioned — learning from mistakes and improving the prompts. Want me to add this to a "lessons learned" file?

[2026-02-07 00:30:25] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, please have the analyst rework this and do better.

Start immediately.

[2026-02-07 00:30:45] Claw Torque:
Analyst re-running with better prompt. Targeting:

• Specific step-by-step workflows
• Daily/weekly rituals
• Exact prompts shared
• Numbers/costs mentioned
• Warnings/gotchas
Running now — will deliver `YOUTUBE-FINDINGS-V2.md` shortly.

[2026-02-07 00:31:20] Dieter Werwath:
We should update the analyst job desc.

[2026-02-07 00:31:54] Claw Torque:
Done — `team/agents/analyst.md` created with research standards baked in:

**Core rules:**

• Specific workflows, not themes
• Daily/weekly rituals with timing
• Exact prompts verbatim
• Numbers and metrics
• Specific tools named
• Warnings and gotchas
• Quality check: "Could someone implement this tomorrow?"
Future analyst tasks will use this as context. Lesson learned → codified. 📝

[2026-02-07 00:32:43] Claw Torque:
V2 just landed — much better. 15+ specific workflows, exact prompts to steal, the $120 disaster story, overnight build cycle pattern. Check `YOUTUBE-FINDINGS-V2.md` in GitHub when you get a chance.

Key one: **"Scope work before bed → Agent builds overnight → Ship as PR → Morning review"** — that's the rhythm we need.

[2026-02-07 00:34:18] Dieter Werwath:
Nice! But... Let's discuss what you just did an verify how this works (and if it can scale)

1) task is created
2) you assign
3) subagent starts work
Are you saying taht the first thing they do is check one file, which for the analyst, tells them to check another file?

Is that really the most efficient option?

[2026-02-07 00:34:35] Claw Torque:
Good question — let me clarify what actually happens:

**Current reality:**

1. I call `sessions_spawn(task="[detailed prompt]")`
2. Sub-agent receives ONLY that prompt
3. They do NOT automatically read `team/agents/analyst.md`
**So the job desc file is actually:**

• My reference when writing prompts
• A template I should copy from
• NOT auto-injected into sub-agents
**To make them read it, I'd have to:**

```sessions_spawn(task="Read team/agents/analyst.md first, then do X...")
```
That's an extra file read for every task — not efficient.

**Better options:**

```| Approach                                 | Efficiency   | Consistency      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| A. Paste key rules into prompt           | ✅ Fast       | 🟡 Manual        |
| B. "Read file first" instruction         | ❌ Extra read | ✅ Always current |
| C. Build spawn wrapper that auto-injects | ✅ Fast       | ✅ Consistent     |
```
Right now I should do **A** — paste the critical rules directly into spawn prompts. The job desc file is my source of truth to copy from.

Does that make sense, or should we build something smarter?

[2026-02-07 00:36:17] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, that's fine! But just to check, did you update the analyst job desc or did you create a separate md for the recent YouTube rules?

[2026-02-07 00:36:26] Claw Torque:
I created `team/agents/analyst.md` WITH the research rules baked in — it's all one file. The research standards are part of their core job description, not separate.

So:

• ✅ `team/agents/analyst.md` — created, includes research standards
• ❌ No separate "YouTube rules" file
The analyst's job desc now says things like:

• "Specific workflows, not themes"
• "Exact prompts verbatim"
• "Quality check: Could someone implement this tomorrow?"
One source of truth for how analyst should behave. When I spawn analyst tasks, I copy the relevant bits into the prompt.

[2026-02-07 00:37:03] Dieter Werwath:
But we already had a job desc for the analyst right?

[2026-02-07 00:37:13] Claw Torque:
Nope! When I checked, we only had:

• `gas-dev.md` ✅
• `pa.md` ✅
• `secretary.md` ✅
No `analyst.md` existed. In `team/TEAM.md`, analyst was listed as "📋 Planned" — role defined but no instruction file yet.

I just created the first one, with the research standards included from day one. Fresh file, not an update.

[2026-02-07 00:39:10] Dieter Werwath:
Aaahhhh!!!! Okok, that's the bit that was confusing me.

Let's check that we have completed the job descs for the rest of the team.

Don't create any yet, just report.

We also need to check models assigned and fix the haiku issue

**Missing job descs (active/planned):** frontend, finance, sales-ops


**Model Assignments (from **[**TEAM.md**](http://team.md/)**):**

```| Agent      | Assigned | Notes                    |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| torque     | opus     | Main session ✅           |
| pa         | haiku    |                          |
| secretary  | flash    | ⚠️ Flash has rate limits |
| gas-dev    | haiku    |                          |
| frontend   | haiku    |                          |
| analyst    | haiku    |                          |
| All others | haiku    |                          |
```

**Haiku Issue:**
When I spawn with `model="haiku"`, I get:

`warning: "model not allowed: anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5"`


Config shows haiku is __defined__ but not in an allowlist somewhere. Sub-agents fall back to opus (expensive).

Want me to dig into the docs for the fix?

[2026-02-07 00:40:14] Dieter Werwath:
Yes please!

[2026-02-07 00:45:23] Dieter Werwath:
Would researcher = analyst? Or should we separate them?

Also... Eqhat happened to your last task of finding out about haiku?!?!

[2026-02-07 00:46:39] Dieter Werwath:
Why are you not replying?

[2026-02-07 00:46:49] Claw Torque:
Sorry! Was deep in config surgery fixing the haiku model allowlist issue you asked about.

**Good news:** Just cracked it. The fix required adding explicit provider configs to `models.providers` — without that, models weren't making it through the allowlist check (empty catalog + no provider config = only default model allowed).

Test just passed: `modelApplied: true` ✅

Now subagents will actually run on haiku instead of secretly falling back to opus. Should cut your subagent costs significantly.

[2026-02-07 00:47:39] Dieter Werwath:
That's great! Can you please whitelist all models? Or should we set that as a downtime task?

[2026-02-07 00:47:53] Claw Torque:
Quick fix - I can do it now. Two options:

1. **Remove the models allowlist entirely** → everything allowed (most permissive)
2. **Keep current setup** → opus, sonnet, haiku, flash, gemini-pro already whitelisted
Which do you prefer? Option 1 means any model string would work, option 2 keeps it to the ones we've defined aliases for.

[2026-02-07 00:48:58] Dieter Werwath:
Pro/cons?

I definitely want codex at some point - ideally we work on figuring out a way to use my current gpt subscription....

[2026-02-07 00:49:16] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Option 1: No allowlist (allow all)**

• ✅ Future-proof — new models work instantly
• ✅ Can experiment freely (codex, gpt, etc.)
• ⚠️ Typos might hit wrong/expensive model
• ⚠️ No guardrails
**Option 2: Explicit allowlist**

• ✅ Clear what's available
• ✅ Aliases make it clean
• ⚠️ Config change needed for each new model
**My take:** Go with option 1 for flexibility. We can add cost guardrails separately if needed.

**Re: GPT subscription** — heads up, ChatGPT Plus/Pro is separate from API access. API requires its own key with pay-per-use billing. Your subscription doesn't transfer.

__However__ — Codex CLI and some newer tools can auth via browser session. Worth exploring. Want me to add "research GPT/Codex integration options" to [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/)?
