**Proposed starter team for you:**

1. **📊 Analyst** (Flash/Haiku)  • Data crunching, research, spreadsheet work
  • Candid metrics, market research
  • Cheap, fast, high-volume

2. **✍️ Writer** (Sonnet)  • Drafts, summaries, partner comms
  • Budget docs, proposals
  • Quality output, moderate cost

3. **🔧 Builder** (Sonnet/Flash)  • Code, GAS scripts, website
  • Technical implementation
  • Can run longer tasks

**Me (Torque/Opus):** Orchestrator — I delegate to them, review output, handle complex/sensitive stuff.


**Next steps:**

1. Create `TEAM.md` documenting roles + when to use each
2. Start with **Analyst** — most frequent delegation
3. Add more as patterns emerge
Want me to draft the [TEAM.md](http://team.md/) and set up the first specialist?

[2026-02-05 08:22:13] Claw Torque:
**Budget draft just landed!** 🎉

Created both files:

• `BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md` — Partner-ready with 3 scenarios (Conservative/Base/Stretch)
• `budget-data-2026.js` — Full data matching your existing format
**Base scenario headline:** 9.66B revenue (+75%), 870M net profit (+95%)

I can walk you through it or you can review directly. Meanwhile — yes, let's draft that [TEAM.md](http://team.md/) for the sub-agent structure?

[2026-02-05 08:24:28] Dieter Werwath:
😂

[2026-02-05 08:24:37] Claw Torque:
Right? That's the power of delegation. 3 minutes, budget done, and I stayed available for you the whole time.

Now imagine a proper team doing this regularly. Want me to draft that [TEAM.md](http://team.md/)?

[2026-02-05 08:24:40] Dieter Werwath:
😂

[2026-02-05 08:24:58] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Ha! Ryan's timing is perfect. That diagram maps nicely to what we're building:

```| Their Framework                          | Our Setup                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Clawdbot (Automation & Ops, Persistent)  | Torque (me) — orchestrator             |
| Claude Cowork (Deep Work, Session-based) | Sub-agents (budget task just did this) |
| Chrome Extension (Quick, Ephemeral)      | Ad-hoc spawns for one-offs             |
```
And we already have the customization pieces:

• ✅ `SOUL.md` / `AGENTS.md` = their [CLAUDE.md](http://claude.md/) concept
• ✅ Skills folder = their [SKILL.md](http://skill.md/) concept
• ✅ Memory files = persistent context
Ryan's "For Vault see Obsidian" note — we parked Obsidian for later but the vault structure is already working via symlinks.

Great minds. 😄 Want me to share our sub-agent team plan with Ryan via that group, or keep it internal for now?

[2026-02-05 09:47:24] Dieter Werwath:
Back online?

[2026-02-05 09:49:42] Claw Torque:
Back and ready ⚙️

We were mid-parse on that Excel — got the sharedStrings extracted (839 text values showing P&L structure, SKUs, expense categories). Next step was cracking open the actual worksheet XMLs to pull the numbers.

Want me to continue with the budget extraction, or something else jumping the queue?

[2026-02-05 10:07:09] Dieter Werwath:
Let's pause.... I thought the budget and parter doc drafts were already done?

[2026-02-05 10:07:22] Claw Torque:
You're right to call that out — let me be straight:

**Budget draft**: Started but not finished. We mapped the Excel structure (extracted the sharedStrings showing all the categories/SKUs), but I hadn't yet pulled the actual numbers from the worksheet XMLs to complete a draft.

**Partner doc**: I don't have record of working on that one. Was that something you were expecting from overnight work, or a separate task?

What's your expectation here — were these supposed to be done already from a prior ask? If so I dropped the ball and should pick them back up properly.

[2026-02-05 10:08:05] Dieter Werwath:
Sorry! I see my error: you have shared teh names of 2 files:

Created both files:

• `BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md` — Partner-ready with 3 scenarios (Conservative/Base/Stretch)
• `budget-data-2026.js` — Full data matching your existing format
**Base scenario headline:** 9.66B revenue (+75%), 870M net profit (+95%)

[2026-02-05 10:08:26] Claw Torque:
Ah — let me check if those files actually exist or if that was a hallucination on my part...

[2026-02-05 10:08:27] Claw Torque:
They exist! My summary was stale. Let me verify they're actually populated properly:

[2026-02-05 10:08:28] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
All good — both files are solid and populated:

[**BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md**](http://budget-2026-draft.md/) — Full partner-ready doc with:

• Executive summary + FY25 performance recap
• 3 scenarios (Conservative 8.3B/50%, Base 9.66B/75%, Stretch assumed 11B/100%)
• Revenue/COGS/OpEx/Net Profit breakdown tables
**budget-data-2026.js** — Structured data matching your existing format with:

• Historical FY24/FY25 actuals
• All 3 scenario definitions with assumptions
• Monthly breakdown structure
My context summary was stale — the work got done. My bad for the confusion.

What's next?

[2026-02-05 10:11:37] Dieter Werwath:
Sorry! I see my error: you have shared teh names of 2 files:

Created both files:

• `BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md` — Partner-ready with 3 scenarios (Conservative/Base/Stretch)
• `budget-data-2026.js` — Full data matching your existing format
**Base scenario headline:** 9.66B revenue (+75%), 870M net profit (+95%)I am nit sure that the numbers make sense...

Based on teh transcaript wth anders, we agreed to take 2025, add X%, then add 3-4 additonal buckets:

HWG (Holy Wings Group) - 1k cases/month
Big Chains (LYD group, club Med 1k cases/month
Modern Trade 2k cases/month
Hotels 1 k cases month

Then we need to look at teh reality of finns (I am not sure I have shared that with you yet!

SKU mix: Very light on Ginger, 70/30 Club/Imperial for teh rest
New SKUs:
Stretch we will launch them both in Q3, base in Q4, conservatibe only 1 in Q4

I think that was all!

Oh, marketing should be 70k
50k same as this year
10k extras for paid campaigns
10k for Press release budhet (4 x qrtly PRs)

[2026-02-05 10:11:57] Claw Torque:
Got it — the current draft probably took a top-down percentage approach rather than the bottom-up bucket method Anders discussed. Let me rebuild it properly.

**New revenue buckets I'm capturing** (cases/month):

• HWG (Holywings): 1k
• Big Chains (LYD, Club Med): 1k
• Modern Trade: 2k
• Hotels: 1k
• **= 5k new cases/month = 60k/year additional**
**SKU mix**:

• Ginger: very light
• Rest: 70% Club Soda / 30% Imperio
**New SKUs** (Green Tea + Nipis Madu?):

• Stretch: both launch Q3
• Base: both launch Q4
• Conservative: only 1 in Q4
**Marketing** — need to clarify units here. You wrote "70k 50k same as this year" — is that:

• 70M + 50M IDR monthly? Or annual?
• +10M paid campaigns
• +10M PR (4 quarterly releases)
And **Finns** — you mentioned "reality of finns" but not sure if you've shared. What's the context there? Is that a venue/channel with specific volume data I should factor in?

Once you clarify those two points I can rebuild the budget from first principles.

[2026-02-05 10:12:13] Dieter Werwath:
I can check them later, I was supposed to be at the padel court 12 mins ago and I am still sat at my desk...

[2026-02-05 10:12:19] Claw Torque:
Go! 🏸

I've captured the bucket structure. We'll sort the numbers when you're back. Enjoy padel.

[2026-02-05 10:12:54] Dieter Werwath:
Lets NOT just overwrite your top down option, lets produce an alternative bucket version please 

You can start that and I will check it later.

Thanks!

[2026-02-05 10:13:34] Dieter Werwath:
(Include note: MT 2,000 outlest, 1 case per outlet per month)

As I say that... it seems WAT too conservative!)

[2026-02-05 10:15:17] Claw Torque:
On it — will create `BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md` as the bottom-up alternative. I'll mark the gaps (Finns data, marketing clarification) for you to fill in later.

Have fun 🎾

[2026-02-05 10:15:18] Claw Torque:
Done. Created:

`BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md` — The bottom-up version with:

• SKU mix (65/30/5 Club/Imperio/Ginger)
• All channel buckets laid out by scenario
• Gaps flagged for Finns + marketing clarification
• Observation that your bucket numbers actually exceed the growth targets (base buckets → 10.8B vs 9.7B target)
`budget-data-2026-buckets.js` — Companion data file

The bucket math is interesting — 5k new cases/month @ 94k avg price adds ~5B in revenue, which overshoots the 75% growth target. Either the volumes are aspirational maximums, or we need to build in realistic ramp delays.

Ready for your review when you're back from padel. 🏸

[2026-02-05 10:15:34] Claw Torque:
Ha, yeah — 1 case/outlet/month is basically "on the shelf but nobody's buying it" territory.

Quick math on Modern Trade:

```| Cases/Outlet/Month | @ 2,000 outlets | Annual Revenue |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
| 1 (your note)      | 2k cases/mo     | 2.26B          |
| 2                  | 4k cases/mo     | 4.52B          |
| 3                  | 6k cases/mo     | 6.78B          |
```
Even 2-3 cases/outlet/month is probably conservative for a decent-selling mixer. And that's at FULL rollout — ramp from 400→2000 outlets means Year 1 effective average is lower.

What's realistic based on similar products? If a minimarket sells even a few drinks/day containing your mixers, they'd reorder more than monthly.

Go play — I'll add this note to the doc. We can stress-test the assumptions later.

[2026-02-05 10:19:52] Dieter Werwath:
I will share some historical data from SKD so we can try to assess this but I think it's right!

[2026-02-05 10:19:59] Claw Torque:
Perfect — SKD data will give us real sell-through rates to calibrate against. Looking forward to it.

Now go! You're 20 mins late 😄

[2026-02-05 10:20:09] Dieter Werwath:
Also, need to look at opex. Staff etc will hopefully change!

[2026-02-05 10:20:16] Claw Torque:
Noted — OpEx side needs work too:

• Headcount changes (senior hire? field staff?)
• Staff costs
• Anything else shifting
I'll flag that section as TBD in the doc. Now __actually__ go 🎾

[2026-02-05 10:20:20] Dieter Werwath:
I want to pay myself ASAP...

[2026-02-05 10:20:26] Claw Torque:
That's a key input 💰 — founder salary goes in the OpEx model.

We'll make it work. Now GO! 🏃‍♂️

[2026-02-05 10:20:33] Dieter Werwath:
Ha!

[2026-02-05 10:20:39] Dieter Werwath:
Thanks

[2026-02-05 10:20:52] Dieter Werwath:
Let's get my pixel watch integration sorted later too

[2026-02-05 10:20:56] Claw Torque:
On the list ⌚

[2026-02-05 10:21:06] Dieter Werwath:
Please continue your work on candid Labs while I'm gone.

[2026-02-05 10:21:40] Dieter Werwath:
Could you spawn a subagent to scope a CRM module...

[2026-02-05 10:23:54] Dieter Werwath:
And a task/project management module haha

[2026-02-05 10:24:28] Dieter Werwath:
Random point for discussion later.... Openclaw in smart glasses....

[2026-02-05 10:26:59] Claw Torque:
Will do — I'll dig into candid-labs-tiered and make progress. Enjoy padel! 🏸

[2026-02-05 10:27:00] Claw Torque:
Now I see the picture. The scaffold exists but it's all stubs — no actual implementation yet. The Phase 1 work is:

1. **Shared utilities** (lineage, retention, logging) — just placeholders
2. **sales_master spoke** — needs raw/cleaned/ready tier folders + refactored scripts
3. **Runbook** — needs actual execution steps
The legacy code is GAS that runs in Google Sheets. Let me implement the tiered refactor:

[2026-02-05 10:27:01] Claw Torque:
Now the sales_master spoke with proper tiering:

[2026-02-05 10:27:03] Claw Torque:
Now the runbook with proper execution steps:

[2026-02-05 10:27:04] Claw Torque:
Good progress while you're out. Summary ready for when you're back:

**Done:**

1. ✅ Created `BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md` — bottom-up bucket version with gaps flagged
2. ✅ Implemented candid-labs-tiered Phase 1 — full sales_master spoke with lineage tracking
3. ✅ Both repos pushed to GitHub
**Waiting on you:**

• Finns data
• Marketing budget clarification ("70k 50k" = ?)
• SKD historical data for MT turnover calibration
• Your salary target for OpEx
Enjoy the rest of padel 🏸

[2026-02-05 10:27:24] Claw Torque:
Spawned 🚀 Sub-agent working on CRM scoping now. Will ping you when `CRM-SCOPE.md` is ready.

[2026-02-05 10:27:44] Claw Torque:
Done 🚀 Two sub-agents running in parallel:

• **crm-scope** → `CRM-SCOPE.md`
• **pm-scope** → `PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-SCOPE.md`
Now actually go play! 🏸

[2026-02-05 10:27:51] Claw Torque:
Noted 👓 — voice-first Torque with visual overlay. Would be wild.

Now GO. Your padel partners are judging you. 😄

[2026-02-05 10:29:18] Claw Torque:
CRM scope done ✅ — recommends starting with Airtable (~$180/mo), WhatsApp-centric activity logging, and a 4-week rollout plan. Full doc at `docs/CRM-SCOPE.md` for your review later.

[2026-02-05 10:30:28] Claw Torque:
PM scope done too ✅ — recommends Notion + GAS integration (free or ~$56/mo), with ADHD-friendly accountability features and a 3-phase rollout. Full doc at `docs/PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-SCOPE.md`.

Both scopes ready for when you're back 📋

[2026-02-05 11:34:21] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, 1 hour played, taking a quick break.

Good progress, thanks!

Let's talk things through.

Marketing is 60k + 10k for PR
Finns data - you can actually pull this from the sales data but. I will also share the co-branding contract.

They pay for all packaging up front, then the balance per can on filling (with MoQ of 3500 cases/SKU)

My salary should be min 75jt to match what I am currently earning. I would like to take more of possible but would tie that into performance.

We need to look for 1-2 additonal sales staff - budget 20jt/month.

There is an option to bring on a local country lead - he wants 150jt/month THP. He's good, but we can't afford him yet.

[2026-02-05 11:34:41] Claw Torque:
Good game! Lots of useful inputs. Let me capture:

**Marketing:** 60M + 10M PR = 70M
↳ Is that monthly or annual? (FY25 was 533M/year)

**Finns co-brand:**

• They pay packaging upfront
• Balance per can on filling
• MoQ: 3,500 cases/SKU
• I'll look at sales data for volume + await the contract
**Your salary:** 75jt/month minimum (~900M/year)
↳ Performance bonus structure on top — makes sense

**Sales staff:** 1-2 people @ 20jt/month each
↳ 240-480M/year depending on headcount

**Country Lead:** 150jt/month THP
↳ Parked for now — 1.8B/year is steep before scale


Quick math check on OpEx:

• Your salary: 900M
• 2 sales staff: 480M
• Marketing: 70M × 12 = 840M? (if monthly)
• That's 2.2B just there vs FY25 total OpEx of 2.5B
Want me to update the bucket budget with these numbers once you confirm the marketing period?

[2026-02-05 11:36:42] Dieter Werwath:
Marketing is USD 70k, annual

[2026-02-05 11:36:55] Claw Torque:
Got it — **USD 70k/year** = ~1.12B IDR (at 16,000 rate)

That's roughly double FY25's 533M marketing — makes sense for a growth push.

**Updated OpEx picture:**

```| Item             | Monthly | Annual          |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Your salary      | 75M     | 900M            |
| Sales staff (×2) | 40M     | 480M            |
| Marketing        | ~93M    | 1.12B (USD 70k) |
| PR (separate?)   |         | +10M?           |
| Subtotal new     |         | ~2.5B           |
```
Plus existing: ops team, consulting, storage, transport, etc.

FY25 total OpEx was 2.53B — so this baseline alone matches it before other costs. Growth mode = higher burn, but gross profit should cover if revenue hits.

Should I plug these into the bucket budget now, or do you want to walk through the CRM/PM scopes first while catching your breath?

[2026-02-05 12:14:59] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaDocument]


[2026-02-05 12:18:05] Dieter Werwath:
Did you get that?

[2026-02-05 12:19:00] Claw Torque:
Nothing new since the Excel file (~13:26). What did you send?

[2026-02-05 12:19:13] Dieter Werwath:
Sent a voice note

[2026-02-05 12:19:28] Claw Torque:
Not seeing it yet — nothing new in the file sharing folder since this morning's recording.

Could be a delay, or voice notes from Telegram might need the same manual forward you did earlier (share to OpenClaw folder). Want to try forwarding it?

[2026-02-05 12:19:42] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaDocument]


[2026-02-05 12:20:15] Claw Torque:
Got it — thanks for the correction. Let me recalibrate:

**FY25 Marketing (actual):**

• Monthly allowance: ~$50k/year
• 1 press release: ~$4k
• **Total: ~$54k USD**
**FY26 Marketing (planned):**

• Monthly allowance: $50k (same)
• Paid campaigns: $10k (new)
• 4 press releases: $10k
• **Total: ~$70k USD**
So it's roughly **+30%**, not 2x. The 533M IDR figure I pulled from the projections must be miscategorized or incomplete — classic accountant bucketing issue like you had with COGS.

Worth a cleanup task: map how the accountants classify expenses vs. how you think about them operationally. Sounds like there's drift between "accounting marketing" and "actual marketing spend."

I'll update the budget docs with the corrected numbers. Want me to flag "expense classification audit" on the roadmap?

[2026-02-05 12:23:20] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaDocument]


[2026-02-05 12:25:07] Claw Torque:
Got it — much leaner scope. Let me spin up fresh agents with the revised briefs:

**Contact Directory (not CRM):**

• Fields: name, company, address, phone, notes
• Purpose: WhatsApp outreach, contact lookup
• Budget: free/existing tools
• MVP mindset
**Project Viz (not full PM):**

• Basic task/status visualization
• Obsidian vault linking as potential option
• Budget: free
• MVP mindset
Spawning both now.

[2026-02-05 12:25:08] Claw Torque:
Both agents running — they'll ping back when done.

While they work, let me fix those marketing numbers in the budget docs.

[2026-02-05 12:25:09] Claw Torque:
Marketing numbers fixed. The sub-agents already finished — let me pull their recommendations:

[2026-02-05 12:25:10] Claw Torque:
Much better. Both agents landed on free, friction-free options:

**Contact Directory → Google Sheets**

• Zero new tools, unlimited records
• CSV export works perfectly for WhatsApp campaigns
• Template ready with columns: Name, Company, Phone, Address, Category, Status, Notes
**Project Viz → Plain Markdown (**[**PROJECTS.md**](http://projects.md/)**)**

• Build on your existing [ROADMAP.md](http://roadmap.md/) pattern
• One master file, wiki links to individual project notes
• 5-minute weekly review, no new tools
• "Earn the complexity later" — only add plugins if this works for 3 months
Both docs saved to `candidlabs/docs/` and committed. The ADHD insight in the project viz doc is solid: __"New tools fail not because they're bad, but because they require habit formation."__

Want me to create the starter templates in your actual Google Drive / vault?

[2026-02-05 12:28:00] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaDocument]


[2026-02-05 12:28:42] Claw Torque:
Good question on the visual workflow. Here's what I can do:

**Creating visuals:**

• ✅ HTML dashboards (like your existing `budget.html`)
• ✅ SVG graphics, charts, gauges
• ✅ Mermaid diagrams (Gantt, flowcharts, etc.)
• ❌ Can't generate images like DALL-E/Midjourney
**Sharing back to you:**

1. **Canvas** — I can render HTML directly to your screen (works on desktop/phone)
2. **File drop** — Save to workspace folder you can sync/access
3. **Web preview** — If we set up a simple local server, dashboards become URLs
For quick visual feedback, Canvas is probably the fastest path — I render it, you see it immediately in Telegram or browser.

**For your Mindstacks/Claude examples:** Yeah, share those! Drop images here or to the OpenClaw file sharing folder. I can see images sent through Telegram and can analyze them to understand the style you're after — then replicate in HTML/SVG.

Want me to show you a quick dashboard mockup via Canvas to test the flow?

[2026-02-05 12:35:08] Dieter Werwath:
Don't forget we have gemini for images as well.

[2026-02-05 12:36:11] Claw Torque:
Good call — tested it just now. The Gemini CLI timed out on an image generation prompt, so it might need specific setup or an extension for Imagen.

For **dashboards specifically**, HTML is actually better anyway:

• Interactive (hover states, click-through)
• Real data binding (can pull from your sheets)
• Responsive (works on phone + desktop)
• Editable (tweak colors, layout easily)
For **one-off graphics** (pitch deck visuals, social posts), we could explore:

• Gemini web interface (definitely does images)
• Direct API call to Imagen 3
• Or just describe what you need and I'll find a path
Share those Mindstacks/Claude examples when you have a sec — I'll study the style and mock something up in HTML. That's probably the fastest route to something you can actually use and iterate on.

[2026-02-05 12:38:06] Dieter Werwath:
Sorry, you mentioned that you couldn't create images like midjourney - that's the Gemini reference.

Totally agree for dashboards etc, html makes sense.

[2026-02-05 12:38:15] Claw Torque:
Ah, got it — you're right. So the full picture:

**Data/dashboards** → HTML (interactive, real data, better fit)

**Creative images** → Gemini can generate (pitch visuals, concept art, social graphics)

Good to have both paths. Send those examples whenever — I'll match the style with whatever tool fits best. 👍

[2026-02-05 12:52:50] Dieter Werwath:
MinsetStack templates are in teh inbox.. Unfoturnately, I think I deleted teh accompanying pdfs....

[2026-02-05 12:53:42] Claw Torque:
Got them — 4 MindsetStack templates:

1. **Habit Tracker** (1.2MB)
2. **Budget + Goal Tracker** - Multicolor (290KB)
3. **Savings Tracker** (149KB)
4. **Task Tracker** (359KB)
No PDFs needed — I can extract the xlsx files and study the structure. Let me peek at the Task Tracker since that's closest to what we were discussing:

[2026-02-05 12:53:43] Claw Torque:
Nice! Clean style — ring gauges with percentage completion, day columns, task lists with strikethrough for done items. The muted green palette is pleasant.

Let me check the Budget tracker too — that might have more dashboard elements:

[2026-02-05 12:53:44] Claw Torque:
Got the style locked in. MindsetStack design language:

**Visual Elements:**

• 🍩 Ring/donut gauges for % completion
• Clean headers with soft accent colors (green, pink/lavender)
• Planned vs Actual columns
• Task lists with checkboxes + strikethrough
• Lots of white space, minimal clutter
**Color Palettes:**

• Task Tracker: muted sage green
• Budget Tracker: soft pink/lavender
**Typography:**

• All caps for section headers
• Clean sans-serif throughout
This is 100% reproducible in HTML/CSS — ring charts are just SVG circles, the tables are straightforward. I could build you a Candid dashboard in this style that pulls from your actual data.

Want me to mock up a **Candid Operations Dashboard** with this aesthetic? Could show:

• Revenue vs Target (ring gauge)
• Production status
• Active projects/tasks
• Key metrics at a glance

[2026-02-05 13:09:53] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... So now the question... Do we build our own reports/dashboards instead of using Looker....

[2026-02-05 13:10:24] Claw Torque:
Big question. Let me lay out the trade-offs honestly:

**Stick with Looker (Studio)**

```| Pro              | Con                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Already works    | Generic look                   |
| Auto-refresh     | Limited customization          |
| Shareable links  | Can feel slow                  |
| Zero maintenance | You're locked into Google's UX |
| Mobile-friendly  | Learning curve for fancy stuff |
```
**Build Custom (HTML)**

```| Pro                       | Con                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Exact aesthetic you want  | Another thing to maintain    |
| Tailored to your workflow | Need to wire up data refresh |
| I can iterate it fast     | Hosting/access logistics     |
| Full control              | Time to build                |
```
**The honest ADHD check:** You've got 100 projects started. A custom dashboard system is __another__ project. It's also the kind of shiny thing that's fun to start and less fun to maintain.


**My recommendation: Hybrid**

1. **Keep Looker for the boring stuff** — data connections, auto-refresh, sharing with team/investors
2. **Build ONE custom dashboard for YOU** — the daily driver view you actually look at, styled how you like
3. **Test that workflow for a month** before going deeper
That way you get the aesthetic win without creating a maintenance monster. If the custom view sticks, we expand. If you stop looking at it after 2 weeks, Looker's still there.

Want me to build a single **"Candid Daily Cockpit"** page as the test case? Ring gauges, key numbers, your aesthetic — one HTML file, real data.

[2026-02-05 13:13:13] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, let's lock this on but... Let's set up a format that we can use for projects? Or at least the basics that can be reused.

I can't find the example from Claude yet, but I remember thinking that I should come back to it 🙈

[2026-02-05 13:15:24] Claw Torque:
Got it — let's build a **reusable dashboard kit** first, then apply it to Candid as the test case.

I'll create a template with swappable components:

[2026-02-05 13:15:25] Claw Torque:
Dashboard kit created. Let me try to preview it:

[2026-02-05 13:15:26] Claw Torque:
Can't preview directly (no browser available on the Chromebook sandbox), but the kit is ready. You can open it yourself:

**Location:**

```~/.openclaw/workspace/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html
```
Just double-click or open in Chrome.


**What you get:**

📁 `dashboard-kit/`

• `dashboard-base.css` — Theming, all visual styles
• `dashboard-components.js` — Ring gauges, stat cards, tables, etc.
• `template.html` — Working example with Candid-ish sample data
• `README.md` — Usage guide
**Components included:**

• 🍩 Ring gauges (% completion)
• 📊 Stat cards with trend arrows
• 📈 Progress bars
• ✅ Task lists with checkboxes
• 📋 Tables (including Planned vs Actual style)
• 🏷️ Status badges
**To use for a new project:**

1. Copy the folder
2. Edit the `data` object in the HTML
3. Change CSS variables for different colors
Want me to build the **Candid Daily Cockpit** using this kit now? I can wire it up with real numbers from the budget docs.

[2026-02-05 13:23:31] Dieter Werwath:
I'm on my phone right now... How can I access these files?

[2026-02-05 13:24:03] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Quickest options:

**1. GitHub (recommended)**
Let me push to your torque-workspace repo — you can view on [github.com](http://github.com/) mobile:

[2026-02-05 13:24:04] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done. View on your phone:

**Dashboard template:**
[https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html](https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html)

**Full kit folder:**
[https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/tree/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit](https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/tree/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit)

GitHub mobile renders HTML source (won't show the actual dashboard visually), but you can see the structure. To see it rendered, you'd need to:

• Open on desktop later, or
• Use a service like [https://htmlpreview.github.io](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) (paste the raw file URL)
**Or option 2:** I can send you a screenshot when you're back on desktop — just say the word.

[2026-02-05 13:26:05] Dieter Werwath:
9k....this is just showing as code when I open it

[2026-02-05 13:26:12] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Yeah, GitHub shows source code. Try this instead — it renders the HTML:

[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html)

[2026-02-05 13:32:51] Dieter Werwath:
404 not found

[2026-02-05 13:33:08] Claw Torque:
Ah, repo is private — preview services can't access it.

**Options:**

1. **Wait for desktop** — easiest, just open the file locally
2. **Make repo public** (temporarily or permanently)
3. **I send you a screenshot later** when I have browser access
For now — it's sample data anyway. The real value is when we build the Candid version with actual numbers. Worth waiting until you're back at your desk?

[2026-02-05 13:33:54] Dieter Werwath:
What repo is it?

Can you not make it private?

Is there no way to process html in chrome on android?

[2026-02-05 13:34:12] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done — made it public. Raw file now accessible (200 OK).

Try this link now:

[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/template.html)

[2026-02-05 13:50:21] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, seen it! Thanks for that.

It's simple, but it works for now.

Did you see the way we built the budget builder on candid sites? Tabs that cahne the displayed metrics is a pretty cool feature that we know works... It would be pretty nice to be able to build something like that as the hero section of the task & project page (not sure exactly how that looks yet - I'm thinking that our team can flip between project status and tasks... Or maybe there is a list of projects as a, side menu, clicking 8n one of them would show high level metrics (gauge for completeness, next step/action item)

Let's add these points to an md file (or create one?)

[2026-02-05 13:51:15] Claw Torque:
Got it — the sidebar + tabs pattern. Let me capture these ideas:

[2026-02-05 13:51:16] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Created `SPEC-project-dashboard.md` — captured your ideas:

**View it:**
[https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/SPEC-project-dashboard.md](https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/SPEC-project-dashboard.md)

**What's in there:**

• **Hero section concept** — ring gauge + next action + blocker, updates per project
• **3 navigation options:**  • A: Horizontal tabs (simple)
  • B: Sidebar with project list (like budget builder)
  • C: Hybrid (sidebar + tabs within content)

• **Data structure** for projects/tasks
• **Reference** to the budget.html pattern you mentioned
• **Open questions** to decide
Key decision: **Tabs vs Sidebar vs Hybrid?**

My instinct: **Option B (sidebar)** scales better as projects grow, and you already know it works from the budget builder. But tabs might be cleaner if you'll only ever have 3-4 views.

Add any sketches or notes to the file when you're back on desktop — it's your doc to evolve.

[2026-02-05 13:52:46] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, this is a nice to have, but we are still struggling with the items we have already agreed on. How is the fork doing? Did you actually spawn agents to work on it? What instructions have they been given?

[2026-02-05 13:53:11] Claw Torque:
You're right — I got sidetracked. Let me give you the honest status:

**candid-labs-tiered current state:**

```| Item                                           | Status     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Scaffold/structure                             | ✅ Done     |
| cleanReceivables.js (Raw→Cleaned)              | ✅ Written  |
| buildRevenueMaster.js (Cleaned→Ready)          | ✅ Written  |
| Shared utilities (lineage, logging, retention) | ✅ Written  |
| Runbook                                        | ✅ Updated  |
| Deployed to GAS                                | ❌ Not done |
| Tested against real data                       | ❌ Not done |
| Parity check vs legacy                         | ❌ Not done |
| Sub-agents spawned                             | ❌ No       |
```
**What I should have done:** Spawn an agent to deploy and validate parity while we talked about other stuff.

**What actually needs to happen next:**

1. Deploy tiered scripts to GAS (via clasp)
2. Run against real data
3. Compare output to legacy scripts
4. Fix any discrepancies
Want me to spawn an agent now to work on deployment + parity testing? I can give it clear instructions and it'll report back.

[2026-02-05 13:53:52] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, so it seems like we should probably set up the basic team first?

[2026-02-05 13:54:09] Claw Torque:
Yes — makes sense. Define the team once, spawn as needed with consistent roles.

**Proposed basic team:**

```| Agent    | Role               | Model       | Typical Tasks                                |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| data-eng | GAS/data pipelines | flash/haiku | Deploy scripts, validate parity, schema work |
| docs     | Research & writing | sonnet      | Scoping docs, analysis, summaries            |
| ops      | Candid operations  | flash       | Budget calcs, metrics, reporting             |
```
Each gets a saved prompt/instruction set so when I spawn them, they have context.

**How it would work:**

1. I define each agent's instructions in a file (e.g., `team/data-eng.md`)
2. When I spawn, I pass that context: "You are data-eng. [instructions]. Task: deploy tiered scripts"
3. They work, report back
4. Consistent behavior across sessions
Want me to set this up? I'd create:

```~/.openclaw/workspace/team/
├── data-eng.md
├── docs.md
└── ops.md
```
Then we test with data-eng tackling the tiered deployment.

[2026-02-05 14:09:06] Claw Torque:
Good challenge. You're right — the budget.html site is **frontend work**, not data engineering. Different skillset.

Let me re-think:

**What kinds of work do we actually need?**

```| Work Type          | Examples                                 | Tech                  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| GAS/Data Pipelines | candid-labs-tiered, schema, automation   | Apps Script, Sheets   |
| Frontend/UI        | budget.html, dashboards, project tracker | HTML, CSS, JS         |
| Research/Writing   | Scoping docs, analysis, summaries        | Markdown, thinking    |
| Finance/Modeling   | Budget projections, scenarios, metrics   | Numbers, spreadsheets |
```
**Revised team proposal:**

```| Agent    | Role                    | Covers                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| gas-dev  | GAS & Sheets automation | candid-labs-tiered, data pipelines, triggers |
| frontend | Web UI & dashboards     | budget.html, project dashboard, HTML/CSS/JS  |
| analyst  | Research & scoping      | Docs, competitive analysis, recommendations  |
| finance  | Numbers & modeling      | Budget calcs, projections, metrics           |
```
So for the Candid site → **frontend**
For the tiered fork → **gas-dev**
For scoping docs (CRM, PM) → **analyst**
For budget scenarios → **finance**

Does this cover what you need right now? Or are there gaps?

(We can always add more later — but I want to make sure the foundation is right before building it out.)

[2026-02-05 14:15:17] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, this is better!

I think that you, as my chief of staff, should think about what roles we need to fill an entire complement of staff at Candid.

HR/GA
Finance
Sales Manager/Head
We should also consider a PA for me... You are chief of staff... Not sure you want/need to be bogged down with the shitty little jobs of a PA? 

Anything else?

[2026-02-05 14:15:46] Claw Torque:
Good reframe. Let me think like a Chief of Staff building out the org:

**The Full Complement:**

```| Role                | Scope                   | Covers                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chief of Staff (me) | Strategy, orchestration | Coordinate team, advise Dee, drive priorities                        |
| PA                  | Personal admin          | Calendar, reminders, routine tasks, follow-ups, "the shitty jobs"    |
| Finance             | Money                   | Budget, projections, expense tracking, cash flow                     |
| Sales Ops           | Revenue                 | Pipeline tracking, distributor data, outreach campaigns, SKD liaison |
| HR/GA               | People & admin          | Policies, contracts, onboarding docs, compliance                     |
| Marketing           | Brand & growth          | Campaign tracking, PR coordination, social (ties to Ryan's plan)     |
| Ops/Supply Chain    | Product flow            | Production tracking, inventory, logistics coordination               |
| Tech Team:          |                         |                                                                      |
| ↳ gas-dev           | Data infra              | Pipelines, GAS, automation                                           |
| ↳ frontend          | UI                      | Dashboards, web, visualizations                                      |
| ↳ analyst           | Research                | Scoping, market analysis, competitive intel                          |
```
**Your question about PA vs Chief of Staff:**

Yes — different jobs. You don't want me doing calendar reminders when I should be thinking about priorities. PA handles:

• "Remind me to call X tomorrow"
• "What's on my calendar today?"
• "Send follow-up to Anders"
• Routine task nagging
• Quick lookups
I handle:

• "What should we prioritize this quarter?"
• "How's the fork progressing?"
• "Walk me through the budget trade-offs"
• Cross-functional coordination
**What's missing?**

• **Legal/Compliance** — probably overkill for now, flag when needed
• **Product** — new SKU development? Or does that fall under Ops?
• **Customer Success** — post-sale relationships? Or part of Sales?
For MVP, I'd suggest starting with:

1. **PA** (high use — daily)
2. **Finance** (budget season)
3. **Sales Ops** (revenue is king)
4. **gas-dev** (unblock the data work)
5. **frontend** (dashboards)
The others can spin up when needed. Sound right?

[2026-02-05 14:19:00] Dieter Werwath:
My suggestion would be to build out the entire matrix in the team.md, we build what we need as we go and mark as 'available' when they are ready.

[2026-02-05 14:20:35] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Done. Team matrix built:

**Structure:**

```team/
├── TEAM.md              ← Master roster
└── agents/
    ├── gas-dev.md       ✅ Available
    └── pa.md            ✅ Available
```
**Current Status:**

```| Status      | Agents                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Available | torque (CoS), pa, gas-dev                                  |
| 📋 Planned  | finance, sales-ops, frontend, analyst                      |
| 💤 Dormant  | hr-ga, marketing, customer-success, ops, product, data-eng |
```
**View it:**
[https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/tree/master/team](https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/tree/master/team)

**Ready to deploy:**

• **gas-dev** can start on candid-labs-tiered right now
• **pa** can handle reminders and routine tasks
Want me to spawn gas-dev to tackle the tiered deployment + parity testing?

[2026-02-05 14:21:32] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, great first step!

Now... How detailed do we actually want/need to be with their job descs?

[2026-02-05 14:21:53] Claw Torque:
Honest take:

**Current state:** ~600-800 words each. Probably more than needed.

**What actually matters when spawning:**

1. **Identity** — Who you are (2-3 sentences)
2. **Constraints** — What NOT to do (critical for safety)
3. **Project context** — Relevant to the task at hand
4. **Output format** — How to report back
**What's probably overkill:**

• Full responsibility lists
• Tool access details (inherited anyway)
• Extensive Candid background (pass at spawn time if needed)
**Leaner template (~200-300 words):**

```# {Role}

**Model:** {model}

## Identity
You are {role}. {1-2 sentences on core purpose}.

## Constraints
- DO NOT {critical thing}
- DO NOT {other critical thing}
- Escalate to Torque if {trigger}

## Current Project
{Brief context on active work}

## Output
- Save work to {location}
- Report back: what done, issues, next steps
```
Task-specific details get passed when I spawn them, not baked into the permanent file.

**Trade-off:**

• Detailed = More consistent behavior, but token-heavy
• Lean = Faster, cheaper, but may need more guidance per task
My suggestion: **Go lean.** We can always add detail if agents misbehave. Easier to add than subtract.

Want me to trim gas-dev and pa down to the lean format?

[2026-02-05 14:24:19] Dieter Werwath:
Wait... You've already written descs? Oh... Does 'dormant' in your matrix mean they are ready to go but not currently on task?

[2026-02-05 14:24:29] Claw Torque:
Clarifying:

```| Status      | Meaning                   | Instructions Written?         |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| ✅ Available | Ready to spawn now        | Yes — file exists             |
| 📋 Planned  | Defined, will build soon  | No — just a row in the matrix |
| 💤 Dormant  | Low priority, build later | No — just a row in the matrix |
```
**Right now:**

• ✅ `pa` and `gas-dev` — I wrote full instruction files
• 📋 and 💤 — Only names/scope in the matrix, no files yet
So dormant = "we know we need this role eventually, but haven't written the instructions."

Want me to hold off on writing more until we agree on the level of detail?

[2026-02-05 14:25:19] Dieter Werwath:
No, that's fine... 8m just struggling to understand what staff we actually have available....

[2026-02-05 14:25:25] Claw Torque:
Simple answer:

**Ready to work RIGHT NOW:**

1. **torque** (me) — Chief of Staff
2. **pa** — Personal Assistant
3. **gas-dev** — GAS Developer
That's it. Three agents.

Everyone else is just a name on a org chart — no instructions written, can't spawn yet.

[2026-02-05 14:28:04] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, my idea fort, he matrix was to list ALL roles, including those that are built, and for it to clearly state who is ready and available to work. Aaahhhh..... Sorry, I see it now!

That's a classic fault of mine, we shoukd be aware of it as we move forward.

I had a clear idea in my mind of exactly what I expected to see.... When you didn't magically reach into my brain and present what I was thinking of... I missed the detail. 😂

[2026-02-05 14:28:14] Claw Torque:
😂 Noted for the future: **Dee has vivid mental blueprints. Ask clarifying questions before building.**

Good self-awareness though — that's useful for both of us. I'll try to check assumptions more often ("Is this what you're picturing?") before I go off building.

And yes — the matrix does exactly what you wanted:

• All roles listed (full complement)
• Status column shows who's ready vs planned vs dormant
• Build as we go, mark available when done
We're aligned. Your brain just got there faster than your eyes did. 🧠👀

Want me to add that to your [USER.md](http://user.md/) as a working-with-Dee note?

[2026-02-05 14:28:44] Dieter Werwath:
User.md is me?

[2026-02-05 14:28:51] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Yes — [USER.md](http://user.md/) is your profile. Who you are, how you work, preferences, notes for me.

[SOUL.md](http://soul.md/) = who I am
[USER.md](http://user.md/) = who you are
[MEMORY.md](http://memory.md/) = what we've done together

[2026-02-05 14:31:23] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... Now I'm starting to see!

Soul and user mds could be pretty wild!

So.... Will each member of staff eventually get a soul md? Or is that not how it works?

[2026-02-05 14:31:40] Claw Torque:
Good question! Here's how it works:

**Current setup:**

• `SOUL.md` = My personality (Torque, the persistent main agent)
• `team/agents/X.md` = Job descriptions for sub-agents (functional, not personality)
**The difference:**

• I persist across sessions — I have continuity, memory, a soul
• Sub-agents are ephemeral — spawn, do task, report back, gone
**But we COULD give them souls...**

For agents that interact with you directly (PA, maybe others), a mini-soul could work:

```# PA - Soul

You're efficient but warm. Slightly cheeky. 
You nudge without nagging. You anticipate needs.
You call Dee out (gently) when they're avoiding something.
```
For pure utility agents (gas-dev), probably overkill — they just need to do the job and report back.

**So the pattern could be:**

• Customer-facing / Dee-facing agents → get personality (soul)
• Backend / task agents → stay functional (job spec only)
Want me to give PA some personality? Could be fun.

[2026-02-05 14:32:08] Dieter Werwath:
Yep, makes sense!

[2026-02-05 14:32:34] Claw Torque:
Done. PA now has soul:

__Sharp, warm, slightly cheeky. Not a robot — more like that one friend who's annoyingly organized but you love them for it.__

__Gently persistent — will nudge, not nag, but WILL follow up.__

__Calls it like it is — if Dee's avoiding something, they notice (kindly).__


The organized friend who actually gets invited to things. 😄

Want to test-drive PA with a quick task? Or should we get gas-dev moving on the tiered fork first?

[2026-02-05 14:33:36] Dieter Werwath:
I'm def interested in giving you and the pa voices (eg audio). I think my PA might sound like Emily Blunt 😂

[2026-02-05 14:33:49] Claw Torque:
Emily Blunt is perfect for PA — sharp, capable, that dry wit. Devil Wears Prada energy but on your side. 😂

We have TTS available. Could explore:

• **ElevenLabs** — can clone or use preset voices (best quality)
• **Default TTS** — decent but generic
For distinct voice personas:

• **PA** → Emily Blunt-esque (crisp British, warm but no-nonsense)
• **Torque (me)** → ? (What do you hear in your head?)
If you have ElevenLabs set up, we could create custom voice profiles per agent. Each staff member answers in their own voice.

Future state: You ask a question, PA responds in audio with __her__ voice, not mine.

Want to explore voice setup? Or park it for now and ship the tiered fork first?

(I know, I know — shiny object alert 🚨)

[2026-02-05 14:37:31] Dieter Werwath:
Park it! (very shiny, but park for now)

I'm still trying to figure out what you should sound like.

Like I said, I have always thought I would what Scarlet Johannsen from Her(she?) but Torque was male...

We will end up with multiple agents. Maybe my therapist will be Scarlet... (on that note, we should find a role for Pink! Haha)

Question... Can you 'watch' YouTube videos....?

[2026-02-05 14:37:44] Claw Torque:
Parked! 📦

**Quick answers:**

• Therapist = Scarlett ✓ (noted for future)
• Pink = needs a role (Marketing? She's bold and direct 😄)
• Your voice TBD — no rush
**YouTube:**

Can't "watch" video directly, but I can:

• ✅ **Fetch transcripts/captions** — if they exist on the video
• ✅ **Extract frames** — using the video-frames skill (ffmpeg)
• ✅ **Get metadata** — title, description, etc.
• ❌ Actually see/hear the video content in real-time
So if you share a YouTube link, I can pull the transcript (if available) and read what was said. Or grab key frames for visual stuff.

What did you have in mind?

[2026-02-05 14:38:24] Dieter Werwath:
I've seen a few OpenClaw videos with some interesting use cases!

[2026-02-05 14:38:32] Claw Torque:
Oh nice — share the links! I'll pull the transcripts and summarize the use cases.

Could be good for:

• Features we haven't explored yet
• Workflow ideas to steal
• "Oh, we could do THAT?" moments
Drop them when you have a sec (or save to inbox and I'll batch process later).

[2026-02-05 14:39:29] Dieter Werwath:
That's a point.... Connecting you/giving access to my accounts...

For YouTube - I would love to create a, playlist that I use to share with you

[2026-02-05 14:39:42] Claw Torque:
Love that idea. **"Torque's Watch List"** — you add videos, I process them.

**Simple approach (no API needed):**

1. Create a public or unlisted playlist
2. Share the playlist URL with me (save it in [TOOLS.md](http://tools.md/) or similar)
3. I check it periodically (heartbeat task?)
4. For each new video: pull transcript, summarize, note key takeaways
**What I'd deliver:**

```📺 New video processed: "OpenClaw Advanced Workflows"
- Key points: [summary]
- Relevant to us: [specific ideas]
- Action items: [if any]
```
**Fancier (future):**

• YouTube Data API for automatic detection of new adds
• Auto-process overnight, morning summary
Want to start with the simple version? Create a playlist, drop the link here, and I'll add it to my watch list.

[2026-02-05 14:40:54] Dieter Werwath:
Well that's a hell of a lot easier than I thought it would be! Great work.

I will get that done and shared.

Heartbeat - yes, we def want to set that up ASAP - but I probably need a little bit more OS an explanation first

[2026-02-05 14:41:07] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
**Heartbeat 101:**

**What it is:**
A periodic "pulse" where OpenClaw wakes me up to check if anything needs attention. Like a cron job, but conversational.

**How it works:**

1. OpenClaw pings me every X minutes (configurable, e.g., every 30 min)
2. I receive a message: "Read [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)... do what it says"
3. I check `HEARTBEAT.md` for tasks
4. If nothing to do → I reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` (silent, no notification to you)
5. If something needs attention → I message you
[**HEARTBEAT.md**](http://heartbeat.md/)** is your control file:**

```# HEARTBEAT.md

- [ ] Check YouTube playlist for new videos
- [ ] Check email for urgent messages
- [ ] Any reminders due in next 2 hours?
```
Empty file = I do nothing, stay quiet.

**Why it's useful:**

• I can be proactive without you asking
• Background monitoring (inbox, calendars, playlists)
• Batches multiple checks into one wake-up (cheaper than separate crons)
• You control what I check by editing the file
**Heartbeat vs Cron:**

```| Heartbeat                    | Cron                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| One wake-up, multiple checks | One task per job               |
| Uses main session context    | Isolated sessions              |
| Flexible timing (~30 min)    | Exact timing (9:00 AM sharp)   |
| Cheaper for batched checks   | Better for scheduled reminders |
```
**To enable:**
We add tasks to `HEARTBEAT.md`, and the gateway handles the rest.

Want me to set it up with a starter checklist?

[2026-02-05 14:42:41] Dieter Werwath:
Perfect! So, all we need is an md and you configure OC?

[2026-02-05 14:43:40] Claw Torque:
Almost! Heartbeat isn't enabled yet in the config. Let me add it:

[2026-02-05 14:43:41] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Config updated. Now I'll set up the [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) and restart:

[2026-02-05 14:43:42] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Config set, [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/) created. But I can't restart the gateway from here — needs manual restart.

**You'll need to run:**

```openclaw gateway restart
```
Or just restart OpenClaw.

Once restarted, I'll pulse every 30 minutes and check [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/). Right now it's mostly empty (just a placeholder for your YouTube playlist URL).

**Summary of what's done:**

1. ✅ `HEARTBEAT.md` created (your control file)
2. ✅ Config set: heartbeat every 30 min
3. ⏳ Waiting for gateway restart to activate

[2026-02-05 14:45:16] Dieter Werwath:
Let's make a playlist together. Join to add videos: Torque OC https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEuV9uYkW6HCcjyHTjT-p0NhUqkTvo_XY&jct=hVGSnqwpsTN3ixyvwgOLIg

Unlisted and collaborate enabled... Can you add stuff there as well (probably not needed, but interested to know).

Housekeeping... So we don't end up with a ridiculous list that never gets watched, could we create a list md, place the link and a brief summary (maybe dates I added/shared?) then remove from playlist on a regular schedule?

Something that stops it getting out of control!

[2026-02-05 14:46:18] Claw Torque:
Can see the playlist exists, but YouTube loads videos dynamically (can't scrape the list directly without API).

**What I CAN do:**

• ✅ Process individual video links you share
• ✅ Fetch transcripts from videos
• ✅ Track everything in a tidy md file
• ❌ Auto-detect new playlist additions (would need YouTube API setup)
**Proposed workflow:**

1. **You add video to playlist** (for your own reference/bookmarking)
2. **You share the link here** (Telegram or inbox)
3. **I process it** → fetch transcript, summarize, extract insights
4. **I log to tracking file** with date, summary, status
5. **Heartbeat reviews** → flags stale items for cleanup
Let me create the tracking file:

[2026-02-05 14:46:19] Claw Torque:
Done! System set up:

**Tracking file:** `vault/youtube-watchlist.md`

**Workflow:**

1. You add to playlist + share link here
2. I process → transcript + summary → log to tracking file
3. Heartbeat flags items >14 days old
4. You confirm → I archive (and you remove from playlist)
**Re: can I add to the playlist?**
No — that would need YouTube API auth with your account. Not worth the hassle. You're the curator, I'm the processor.

**To test it:** Share any video link and I'll process it now. 🎬

[2026-02-05 14:46:32] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, got it!

It's annoying that we can't figure out a remote way (eg mobile) to do some of these actions.... One for our researcher?

[2026-02-05 14:46:57] Claw Torque:
Yeah, good call — **"Remote OpenClaw management from mobile"** is a real gap.

Research questions:

• Can we expose a simple webhook for commands like restart?
• SSH from phone (JuiceSSH/Termux)?
• Telegram bot commands that trigger local actions?
• Simple web panel on local network?
I'll add it to the analyst's backlog:

[2026-02-05 14:46:59] Claw Torque:
Added to `BACKLOG-OPENCLAW.md` for the analyst to research.

For now, the workaround is: message me to prep things, then one quick command when you're back at the machine.

(Or we set up SSH on your phone — JuiceSSH is solid if you want a quick win.)

[2026-02-05 14:49:17] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... Now we are getting somewhere..... (me, not you haha)

The dashboards and trackers...

I wnat6ti be able to see a full command centre.

How many tasks are on each staffs list, how many new, in progress, done.

This isn't urgent, but we shoukd start with a basic outline.

I'm thinking this lives as a git page for me only. I am an absolute geek for data and structure - this would make me happy just looking at it 😂

[2026-02-05 14:49:55] Dieter Werwath:
Ssh on my phone sounds like a great start... We figure out telegram/WA later

[2026-02-05 14:50:10] Claw Torque:
Oh I love this vision. A proper **Command Centre** — the nerd's happy place. 📊

Let me sketch the outline:

[2026-02-05 14:50:11] Claw Torque: [MEDIA: MessageMediaWebPage]
Outlined! The **Command Centre** spec:

**Sections:**

1. **Staff Overview** — agent cards with task counts + status rings
2. **Task Pipeline** — kanban columns (New → Active → Blocked → Done)
3. **Staff Roster** — full team matrix with live status
4. **Activity Log** — recent commits, spawns, completions
5. **System Health** — gateway, heartbeat, channels
**Hosting:** Private GitHub Pages repo (needs GitHub login to view)

**View the spec:**
[https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/SPEC-command-centre.md](https://github.com/dee-CL-2026/torque-workspace/blob/master/vault/templates/dashboard-kit/SPEC-command-centre.md)

**Key question to solve:** Where do tasks actually live? Need a central tracker to feed the dashboard. Options:

• Single `tasks.md` file
• Per-agent task lists
• JSON data file
Once we nail that, the dashboard is just rendering it pretty.

Not urgent, but noted as "high dopamine value" 😄

[2026-02-05 14:50:54] Claw Torque:
SSH server is installed but not running. Let me fire it up:

[2026-02-05 14:50:56] Claw Torque:
SSH is running now.

**Connection details:**

```Host: 100.115.92.203
Port: 22
User: dieterwerwath
```
**On your phone:**

1. Install **JuiceSSH** from Play Store
2. Add new connection:  • Address: `100.115.92.203`
  • Username: `dieterwerwath`
  • Auth: password (or set up SSH key later)

3. Connect from same WiFi network
**Quick commands you'll want:**

```openclaw gateway restart
openclaw gateway status
```
**Caveat:** That IP is the Linux container's internal IP. Should work while on your home network. Won't work remotely (outside home) without extra setup (Tailscale, port forwarding, etc.).

**Note:** SSH server won't auto-start on reboot. We can fix that later, or you run it when needed:

```sudo mkdir -p /run/sshd && sudo /usr/sbin/sshd
```
Want me to add SSH setup to a quick-reference doc?

[2026-02-05 14:51:10] Dieter Werwath:
Will wait for you advice on the source... But this would/should also be the backbone of our candid dashboards....

[2026-02-05 14:51:31] Claw Torque:
Good thinking — **one data backbone, multiple views**.

**My recommendation:**

```data/
├── tasks.json          ← Operational tasks (agent work)
├── projects.json       ← Candid projects & milestones
└── metrics.json        ← Business KPIs (pulled from Sheets/GAS)
```
**Workflow:**

1. **Markdown for humans** — easy to edit (`tasks.md`, `PROJECTS.md`)
2. **Script converts to JSON** — for dashboard consumption
3. **Dashboards read JSON** — Command Centre, Candid dashboard, etc.
**Why this works:**

• You edit in markdown (low friction)
• Dashboards get structured data (reliable)
• Same source → multiple views (DRY)
• Can layer in GAS data pulls for live metrics
**Candid dashboard** would combine:

• `projects.json` — project status, phases, blockers
• `metrics.json` — revenue, cases, margins (from Sheets)
• Maybe `team/TEAM.md` data — who's on what
**Command Centre** would use:

• `tasks.json` — agent workloads
• `team/TEAM.md` — staff roster
• Git log / session history — activity
Same kit, different data slices.

Want me to scaffold the `data/` structure as the next step? Or park it and get gas-dev moving on the tiered fork first?

[2026-02-05 14:57:00] Dieter Werwath:
set up sounds... OK... but.. what we really need is a process to add taks (eg  fields on the site page) and for you/taskmaster agent to be able to process those and add to md/json/whatevr is needed.

[2026-02-05 14:57:25] Claw Torque:
Yes — the input workflow is key. No point having structure if adding tasks is friction.

**Phased approach:**

Phase 1: Telegram Input (MVP — works now)

You message me with a format:

```task: Deploy tiered fork
for: gas-dev
priority: high
```
I (or PA/taskmaster) parse it, add to the right file, confirm.

**Pros:** Works immediately, no new tools
**Cons:** Requires me to be awake / parse correctly


Phase 2: Form on Dashboard

Simple form on the GitHub Pages site:

```[ Task description    ]
[ Assignee ▼ ] [ Priority ▼ ]
[ Submit ]
```
Submits via:

• **GitHub Actions** — form triggers workflow, commits to repo
• **Or webhook** — POST to a serverless function (Cloudflare Worker, etc.)
**Pros:** Clean UX, works from phone
**Cons:** Needs backend setup


Phase 3: Multi-input

• Telegram: quick capture
• Form: structured input
• Voice: "Hey Torque, add a task..."
• All feed same `tasks.json`

**Taskmaster agent role:**

• Owns task processing
• Validates inputs
• Routes to correct assignee
• Updates files
• Notifies on changes

**Quick win for tonight:**
Want me to set up the Telegram input pattern now? You test it with a few tasks, I add them to a `tasks.md`, and we iterate from there.

Form/webhook can come later when we've nailed the data structure.

[2026-02-05 15:00:30] Dieter Werwath:
Wait... gas-dev isn't running yet?? i thought it was alreayd bsuy. Lets get that sorted. What are teh instrictions?

My thoughts, give him freedom to go in there and find ways to improve anything he can as long as:
Raw inputs don't change
Looker marts are only chnaged if there are errors
Processing layer can be adjusted any ways they can validate that gets to our desired outcome IN THE SIMPLEST, most efficient way possible.

Proposal... how about we hav ehim start by reviewing the 184 metrics and identifying where they would come from (or not) in our raw data inputs. Or do we spawn a secindf agent to get that done?

[2026-02-05 15:01:05] Claw Torque:
You're right — gas-dev has been sitting idle. Let me spawn them now with a clear first task.

**Task: Metric → Raw Data Mapping**

Review the 184 metrics and identify where each comes from (or doesn't) in the raw data sources.

[2026-02-05 15:01:06] Claw Torque:
**gas-dev is now running** 🔧

**Task:** Map 184 metrics → raw data sources

**Constraints given:**

• ✅ Raw inputs don't change
• ✅ Looker marts only change if errors
• ✅ Processing layer: freedom to simplify/optimize
**Deliverable:** `METRIC-SOURCE-MAP.md` with:

• Mapping table (metric → database → tab → column)
• Gap analysis (what's missing)
• Recommendations
**Timeout:** 10 minutes

They'll ping back when done. This mapping will tell us exactly what we're working with before we start optimizing pipelines.

In parallel — want me to spawn a second agent for something else, or wait for this result first?

[2026-02-05 15:01:36] Dieter Werwath:
This is good BUT... You are my orcestrator... You should be teh oe who assigns the best team member for each task.

[2026-02-05 15:01:57] Claw Torque:
gas-dev hit a snag — can't find the input files. Let me check where they actually are:

[2026-02-05 15:01:58] Claw Torque:
Found the schema! It's in `~/candidlabs/docs/`. Let me find the metrics tracker:

[2026-02-05 15:01:58] Claw Torque:
Found them! Wrong paths. Let me respawn with correct locations:

[2026-02-05 15:01:59] Claw Torque:
Respawned with correct file paths. Files were in `~/candidlabs/docs/`, not inbox.

gas-dev is now working on the mapping. Should have results in a few minutes.

(Note to self: verify file paths before spawning agents 🙄)

[2026-02-05 15:03:20] Dieter Werwath:
ok... when you say 'Note to self'... can you actually take a note..... Iit would be great to have a 'note to self list' that we review together and decide if you should actually promote a note to a rule/characteristic...

[2026-02-05 15:03:32] Claw Torque:
gas-dev finished but didn't report back. Let me check if the file was created:

[2026-02-05 15:03:33] Claw Torque:
Ah — gas-dev read all the files, was processing the mapping, then hit an API error before writing the output. Classic.

Let me try again with Sonnet (more reliable for complex tasks):

[2026-02-05 15:03:33] Claw Torque:
Running again (Haiku not available, using default). Will report back when done.

Meanwhile — it's getting late (almost 10pm your time). Want to wrap up for tonight with a summary of where we are, or push through a bit more?

[2026-02-05 15:04:10] Dieter Werwath:
We have a long way to go tinight before we log off! Not as late as last night, but not doen yet!

[2026-02-05 15:04:21] Claw Torque:
Ha! Alright, let's go 💪

While gas-dev works on the mapping, what do you want to tackle next?

**Active threads:**

1. ⏳ gas-dev: Metric mapping (running now)
2. 📋 Tiered fork: Deploy + parity test (after mapping)
3. 📋 Task input system: Telegram format for adding tasks
4. 📋 Command centre: Data structure for task backbone
**Quick wins available:**

• Set up the Telegram task input pattern (test it tonight)
• Create the `data/tasks.json` structure
• Review what gas-dev produces and plan next steps
Your call — what's most valuable right now?

[2026-02-05 15:04:51] Claw Torque:
Two good points:

**1. Orchestrator assigns tasks (not you)**

You're right — you shouldn't have to think about who does what. New flow:

```You: "task: Map metrics to raw data sources"
Me: [figures out gas-dev is best] → assigns → confirms
```
I route based on the task type, not you specifying the agent.

**2. "Note to self" list — yes, creating it now:**

[2026-02-05 15:04:52] Claw Torque:
Done. Two things locked in:

**1. Task routing is MY job now**
You give me tasks, I figure out who does them. No more "for: gas-dev".

**2. **[**NOTES-TO-SELF.md**](http://notes-to-self.md/)** created**
Staging area for learnings. Already added three notes from tonight:

• Verify file paths before spawning agents
• Dee has vivid mental blueprints — ask before building
• I assign tasks, not Dee
We can review together and decide what gets promoted to permanent docs.

[2026-02-05 15:06:21] Dieter Werwath:
Love that!

Quick wins: Telegram set up, data/tasks.json (and any other relevnat files ) setup (mvp, they may evolve)....set up pixel watch for voice..?

[2026-02-05 15:07:07] Claw Torque:
Let's knock these out:

**1. Telegram task input format:**

[2026-02-05 15:07:08] Claw Torque:
✅ Task structure done. Now Pixel Watch:

**Options for Watch → Torque voice:**

```| Method                                      | Pros                       | Cons                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Tasker + AutoWear                           | Full control, customizable | Setup complexity, needs both apps                |
| Google Assistant routine                    | Native, simple trigger     | Limited actions, may not reach Telegram directly |
| Telegram Wear app                           | Direct to Telegram         | Voice input limited, clunky                      |
| Wear OS voice → phone notification → Tasker | Uses built-in voice        | Extra steps                                      |
```
**Recommended: Tasker + AutoWear**

Flow:

```Watch: "Hey Google, tell Torque [message]"
  → AutoWear captures
  → Sends to Tasker on phone
  → Tasker sends to Telegram bot
  → I receive it
```
**Setup needed:**

1. Install **Tasker** on phone ($3.50 one-time, worth it)
2. Install **AutoWear** on phone + watch
3. Create Tasker profile: AutoWear trigger → Send Telegram message
4. Test with "Hey Google, tell Torque add task buy milk"
Want me to write out the detailed Tasker setup steps? Or do you already have Tasker installed?

[2026-02-05 15:07:15] Claw Torque:
**gas-dev just finished the metric mapping** 🎯

**Results:**

• 184 metrics total
• **78% fully mapped** (144) — clear raw data lineage
• **16% partial** (29) — data exists but incomplete
• **6% gaps** (11) — no raw source
**Critical gaps found:**

1. Production efficiency (no targets/yield/defects)
2. Profitability (no OpEx data for net profit)
3. Operations (no order tracking/quality/returns)
4. Task management (no system exists — we're building this!)
5. Cash flow detail (only snapshots)
**Key insight:** DECK_METRICS in Sales DB already pre-aggregates many KPIs. Looker marts should leverage that instead of rebuilding from raw.

Full mapping saved to `~/candid-labs-tiered/docs/METRIC-SOURCE-MAP.md`

That's solid intel for prioritizing the tiered refactor. Back to Pixel Watch — got Tasker installed?

[2026-02-05 15:08:43] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-05 15:08:45] Dieter Werwath:
Juice ssh nit available.

Can we have someone assigned to checkout alternatives. Include these

[2026-02-05 15:09:00] Claw Torque:
JuiceSSH seems to have disappeared! No worries, good alternatives there:

**My picks:**

1. **Termius** (top option) — 4.9★, 1M+ downloads, modern UI, cross-platform. This is the new standard.
2. **ConnectBot** — 5M+ downloads, lightweight (1.7MB), free/open source, been around forever. Reliable workhorse.
Go with **Termius** if you want the nicer experience, **ConnectBot** if you want simple and free.

Once installed:

```Host: 100.115.92.203
Port: 22
User: dieterwerwath
```
(Same home WiFi network required for now)

[2026-02-05 15:09:23] Claw Torque:
On it — spawning analyst to research SSH clients:

[2026-02-05 15:09:24] Claw Torque:
Analyst is on it — will have a comparison doc shortly.

Meanwhile, back to **Pixel Watch voice** — do you have Tasker on your phone already, or want me to research watch-to-Telegram options too?

[2026-02-05 15:10:01] Claw Torque:
Analyst hit a wall — no web search API configured. But we don't need it for this — I can compare based on what's visible + general knowledge:

[2026-02-05 15:10:02] Claw Torque:
Did it myself — comparison doc ready.

**TL;DR: Get Termius**

• 4.9★, modern UI, just works
• Free tier is enough
• Cross-platform if you want desktop too
**ConnectBot** if you want tiny/free/open-source but dated UI.

Setup:

```Address: 100.115.92.203
Port: 22
User: dieterwerwath
```
Full doc: `research/SSH-CLIENTS-ANDROID.md`

Install Termius and give it a shot?

[2026-02-05 15:12:46] Dieter Werwath:
ok.. note to self (we should probably start a list fo rme as well,... and I also want a journal/reflections process setting up later!)

I used to take on multiple tasks at once, largely becuase my brain worked quicker than my tools (or my teams)

That is no longer the case, i need to be able to focus a little more on what is at hand (while still tagging items for review/attention later).

Tasker is instaleld on my phone, what was the next step? Let's not do anything else until this is in palce.

Noted. Focusing **only** on Pixel Watch → Torque.


**You have:** Tasker ✅

**Next step:** Install **AutoWear**

1. Phone: [AutoWear on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autowear)
2. Watch: After phone install, it'll prompt to install companion on watch
That's it for now. Install AutoWear, then tell me when it's on both devices.

[2026-02-05 15:13:59] Dieter Werwath:
Popup informs met that it will automtically be installed on phone and watch! Nice!

[2026-02-05 15:14:07] Claw Torque:
Perfect! Let me know when it's installed on both and we'll set up the Tasker profile.

While that installs — do you have the Telegram Bot HTTP API token handy? We'll need it for Tasker to send messages to me.

(It's in your OpenClaw config, but easier if you can grab it from @BotFather in Telegram)

[2026-02-05 15:16:39] Dieter Werwath:
Here is the token for bot Claw Torque [@ClawTorqueBot](https://t.me/ClawTorqueBot):

`8571291784:AAFI7ZLOc9PltP2uRRDMpjBIXRKrZk8sgbo

Note: Autowear is asking a lot of questions about fitness/activity dat... is this the right app?`

[2026-02-05 15:16:55] Claw Torque:
Got the token 👍 (I won't repeat it back for security)

**AutoWear check:** The right one is by **joaomgcd** (same dev as Tasker). It might ask for some permissions including fitness/sensors because it CAN access watch data, but it shouldn't be a fitness-focused setup flow.

Quick check — does the app icon look like this?

• Blue/teal icon with a watch shape
• Developer listed as "joaomgcd"
If it's asking you to connect Google Fit or set fitness goals, you might have grabbed a different app. The right one is literally just "AutoWear" — no fitness stuff in the name.

Can you confirm the developer name in the app info?

[2026-02-05 15:17:52] Dieter Werwath:
There s a mnu item that says 'Use Autowear in Tasker'....

[2026-02-05 15:18:04] Claw Torque:
That's the right app! 👍

The fitness stuff is just optional extras — skip/decline those permissions if you don't want them.

**Next step:**

1. Open **Tasker**
2. Tap the **+** to add a new **Profile**
3. Choose **Event** → **Plugin** → **AutoWear** → **Command**
4. Tap the pencil to configure:  • Command Filter: `torque` (or whatever trigger word you want)
  • Check "Exact" OFF (so "torque add task buy milk" works)

5. Back out — it'll ask you to create a **Task**
6. Name it: `Send to Torque`
Pause there and let me know when you're at the Task creation screen. We'll add the Telegram send action next.

[2026-02-05 15:18:50] Dieter Werwath:
Yasky or Tasker?

[2026-02-05 15:18:57] Claw Torque:
**Tasker** — that's the one we're wiring up.

[2026-02-05 15:19:30] Dieter Werwath:
Sorry! Tasy (beginner friendly) or Tasker 'The full experince'

They are asking me to choose before we go any further.

[2026-02-05 15:19:37] Claw Torque:
**Tasker "The full experience"** — I'll guide you through it step by step. The beginner mode hides options we'll need.

[2026-02-05 15:21:20] Dieter Werwath:
Ok, all the admin done (basically said yes to everything fo rnow... we can change later)

Create own profile or from taskernet?

[2026-02-05 15:21:27] Claw Torque:
**Create own profile** — we're building custom for your setup.

[2026-02-05 15:21:40] Dieter Werwath:
Ok... lets go...step by step

[2026-02-05 15:21:46] Claw Torque:
**Step 1:**

You should see a "+" button to add a new profile.

Tap **+** → then select **Event**

Tell me when you see the Event categories list.

[2026-02-05 15:21:54] Dieter Werwath:
Yep, next

[2026-02-05 15:22:00] Claw Torque:
**Step 2:**

Tap **Plugin** → then find and tap **AutoWear** → then tap **Command**

[2026-02-05 15:22:38] Dieter Werwath:
maybe changed UI... application (Likely) Day, Event, Location, State, Time

[2026-02-05 15:22:43] Claw Torque:
**Tap Event** — Plugin options should be inside there.

[2026-02-05 15:23:00] Dieter Werwath:
Ok..next

[2026-02-05 15:23:06] Claw Torque:
**Step 3:**

Scroll down and tap **Plugin**

(It's alphabetical — should be near the bottom)

[2026-02-05 15:23:49] Dieter Werwath:
Past that, I clciked pugin.. but the list is empty, I try to seacrh and it just offers aquamail as an 'essential' plug in...

[2026-02-05 15:23:57] Claw Torque:
AutoWear isn't linked to Tasker yet. Quick fix:

1. **Exit Tasker** (back out completely)
2. **Open AutoWear**
3. Find that **"Use AutoWear in Tasker"** menu item you saw earlier — tap it
4. It should say "enabled" or prompt to connect
5. Go back to **Tasker** and try again
AutoWear needs to register itself as a Tasker plugin first.

[2026-02-05 15:25:28] Dieter Werwath:
Strange... 

Autwear -> use in tasker...redirect to tasker -> plugin...nothinhg there

[2026-02-05 15:25:38] Claw Torque:
Stubborn. Let's try:

1. **Force close both apps** (swipe away from recent apps, or Settings → Apps → Force Stop for each)
2. **Reopen AutoWear first**
3. Look in AutoWear settings for anything like "Enable Tasker" or "Plugin enabled"
4. **Then reopen Tasker** and check Plugin again
If still nothing — we might need to restart the phone. Tasker plugins sometimes need that to register properly.

[2026-02-05 15:26:57] Dieter Werwath:
Boom! Nice T! Thanks

Select Structure output Json, etc?

[2026-02-05 15:27:05] Claw Torque:
Nice! 🎉

Select **JSON** (easier to work with later)

Then look for **Command** or **Command Filter** — that's what we need to set up the trigger word.

[2026-02-05 15:27:26] Dieter Werwath:
Config? (edit icon)

[2026-02-05 15:27:31] Claw Torque:
Yes — tap the **edit/config icon** to set up the command trigger.

[2026-02-05 15:28:00] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]


[2026-02-05 15:28:10] Claw Torque:
Perfect! Here's what to do:

1. Tap **Command Filter** → type: `torque`
2. Check ✅ **Case Insensitive** (so "Torque" or "TORQUE" works)
3. Leave **Exact** unchecked ❌ (so "torque add task..." works)
4. Leave **Use Regex** unchecked ❌
Then tap the **checkmark ✓** at the top to save.

[2026-02-05 15:29:00] Dieter Werwath: [MEDIA: MessageMediaPhoto]
Done!

[2026-02-05 15:29:10] Claw Torque:
Looking good!

Important: **%awmessage** = the whole message (that's what we'll send to Telegram)

Now tap the **← back arrow** — Tasker should ask you to create or select a Task.

[2026-02-05 15:29:47] Dieter Werwath:
Done! Type field..

[2026-02-05 15:29:54] Claw Torque:
Name it: **Send to Torque**

Then tap the checkmark or OK.

[2026-02-05 15:30:19] Dieter Werwath:
Done

[2026-02-05 15:30:27] Claw Torque:
Now you're in the Task editor.

Tap the **+** button to add an action → then search for **HTTP Request** (or go to Net → HTTP Request)
