## 📊 Status/HUD Features

### Scheduled Context & Token Updates (DM)
**Source:** Group chat 2026-02-05
**Priority:** Medium

- Periodic updates to Dee's DM with:
  - Context window usage (% and tokens)
  - Token consumption since last update
  - Session cost estimate (if trackable)
  - Compaction count
- Frequency: TBD (hourly? daily summary?)
- Could tie into heartbeat system

### On-Demand Status in Groups
**Source:** Group chat 2026-02-05
**Priority:** Medium

- Trigger: "torque status" or similar
- Shows quick HUD-style output:
  ```
  ⚙️ ctx:29% | tokens:58k/200k | compactions:0 | session:45min
  ```
- Already works via `session_status` tool — just needs nice formatting

## 💡 Other Ideas

### 🎙️ "It's All Torque" — Podcast/Blog
**Source:** Late night idea 2026-02-06 00:03
**Priority:** Fun / Long-term

The journey of building a personal AI orchestrator. Documenting:
- Setup, failures, breakthroughs
- What works, what doesn't
- The evolving relationship between human + AI
- Real use cases, not hype

Format TBD: podcast, blog, video series, all of the above?
