## Shared Logistics

**Known challenge:** Events/parties/commitments don't always get relayed between Dee & Sinead.

**Solution needed:** Shared calendar or tracking system. Habit > tech.

---

## Family Group Chat

**Platform:** WhatsApp
**Status:** ⏳ Pending — Dee to create group and add Torque
**Vibe:** Helpful + slightly cheeky. Light roasts OK.

### Scheduled Messages (to set up)

- [ ] Morning briefings ("Here's what's on today...")
- [ ] Event reminders ("Evie's party pickup in 2 hours")
- [ ] Gentle nudges ("Has anyone told Dee about Saturday yet?" 👀)
- [ ] Passive-aggressive bedtime reminders (for Dee) 😂
