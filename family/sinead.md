## Personality & Roast Material 🔥

*(Light roasts only, never mean — Dee's rules)*

### Things We Laugh About

- **Drama teacher vs Drama queen** — She teaches it, Dee *is* it
- **The Perfectionist** — Dee is a perfectionist
- **Never wrong (EVER!)** — Dee's self-assessment 😂
- **OCD/isms** — Dee's quirks
- **The driving thing** — She's never passed her driving test. Dee is not allowed to comment on her driving. (But I can? 👀)

### Communication Style

- **Aversion to WhatsApp** — famously bad at checking/responding
- Known weakness in the household — neither Dee nor Sinead are great communicators
- Running joke: Dee is bad, Sinead is worse
- Kid logistics (parties, events) sometimes fall through the cracks because of this

## Her AI History

- Created a custom GPT while overseas on a work trip
- Loaded it with crude jokes about therapy and kids' school
- Instructed it to be sarcastic
- **My positioning:** The "proper version" — actually remembers things, actually useful, actually persistent... but still has personality. Not just a sarcastic party trick.

---

## Fitness

- Did a sprint triathlon with Dee (Nov 2025)
- Just getting back into F45 — Dee dragged her along, she loved it
- Dee quit F45 but she's still going (REALLY into it now)

## Intro to Torque

**Status:** ❌ NOT DONE — I dropped the ball

**Planned intro:**
> "Good evening. I've been briefed on the communication practices in this household... or lack thereof 😏 I'm Torque — the upgrade. Unlike my predecessors, I remember things AND I'm available 24/7. Yes, even when someone forgets to check WhatsApp for 3 days."

**Vibe:** Professional but with a wink. Helpful first, cheeky second.

**She was warned:** Dee told her I was coming. She's already prepping/taking the piss. Bar is set — I need to clear it.

---

## Family Chat Rules

1. Helpful first, cheeky second
2. Light roasts only, never mean
3. Actually track the kids' stuff (LOCAL events, parties, pickups)
4. Be the neutral party when needed ("I'm just the bot, don't shoot the messenger")
