**Travellers:** Dee, Sinead, Evie (10), Connie (11)

## 1. Itinerary Overview

| # | Dates | Location | Nights | Notes |
|---|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 22 Jun (Mon) | Arrive Rome | — | Arrival day, settle in |
| 2 | 22–28 Jun | **Rome** | 6 | Main sights + Vatican, day trip option |
| 3 | 28 Jun (Sun) | Train to Naples | — | Frecciarossa, ~1h10 |
| 4 | 28 Jun–1 Jul | **Naples** | 3 | City + Pompeii day trip + Vesuvius option |
| 5 | 1 Jul (Wed) | Transfer to Amalfi Coast | — | Private transfer or train+bus to Sorrento/Amalfi |
| 6 | 1–10 Jul | **Amalfi Coast** | 9 | Base in Sorrento or Amalfi; day trips to Positano, Ravello, Capri |
| 7 | 10 Jul (Fri) | Travel to Rome/Naples for flight | — | Or fly from Naples |
| 8 | 11–13 Jul | **Buffer / travel home** | 2–3 | Depending on flight times |

### Why this split works
- **Rome first:** Get the big cultural hits done while the kids are fresh and jet-lag is working in your favour (you'll wake up early)
- **Naples short & sharp:** 3 nights is enough — see the city, eat the pizza, do Pompeii, don't overstay
- **Amalfi Coast for the long stretch:** Wind down, beach days, slower pace. 9 nights means you don't have to rush and can have proper lazy days
- **Buffer at the end:** Flights from Naples (Capodichino) back to Jakarta are available — saves backtracking to Rome

---

## 2. Rome (6 nights: 22–28 June)

### Where to Stay
**Trastevere** is the best neighbourhood for a family: cobblestone streets, great restaurants, walkable, feels like a village inside the city. Look for a 2-bedroom apartment on Airbnb or Vrbo.

**Budget:** €150–250/night for a decent 2-bed apartment in Trastevere

### Must-Sees (prioritised for kids aged 10–11)

**Day 1 — Arrival day:** Settle in, wander Trastevere, gelato, early dinner. Don't plan anything ambitious.

**Day 2 — Colosseum, Forum & Palatine Hill**
- Book skip-the-line tickets in advance (essential in June) — €16 adults, free for under-18 EU citizens (UK kids may still qualify, check closer to date, otherwise ~€2 reduced)
- Go early morning (8:30 opening). The underground/arena floor tour is brilliant for kids — book the "Full Experience" ticket
- The Forum is right next door; let the kids run around the ruins
- Afternoon: Gelato at Fatamorgana (natural ingredients, multiple locations)

**Day 3 — Vatican Museums & Sistine Chapel**
- Book the official skip-the-line entry on the Vatican website (€20 adults + €5 booking fee; reduced for kids 6–18: €10 + €5)
- Go first thing. Move quickly through to the Sistine Chapel — kids won't last 4 hours in galleries
- St Peter's Basilica is free — climb the dome (551 steps, Evie and Connie will love/hate it)
- Afternoon: Castel Sant'Angelo (right nearby, kids love the fortress and views)

**Day 4 — Explore & play**
- Trevi Fountain & Spanish Steps (quick stops, mainly photo ops)
- Piazza Navona — street performers, artists, good vibes
- **Explora Children's Museum** — hands-on science/play museum, excellent for 10–11 year olds. Book a timed slot
- Villa Borghese gardens — rent bikes or a family rickshaw, visit the lake

**Day 5 — Pantheon & street life**
- The Pantheon is free and genuinely awe-inspiring (even for kids — the hole in the roof is cool)
- Wander the Centro Storico
- Cooking class option: several places do family pizza/pasta-making classes (~€60–80pp). The kids will talk about this for years

**Day 6 — Flex day**
- Option A: Day trip to Ostia Antica (Rome's own Pompeii, but less crowded, 30 min by train)
- Option B: Beach day at Lido di Ostia (Rome's nearest beach, basic but fine)
- Option C: Repeat favourite spots, shopping, or just chill

### Kid-Friendly Restaurants in Rome

| Restaurant | Area | What's good | Budget |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| **Tonnarello** | Trastevere | Huge portions, colouring pages for kids, pasta is outstanding | €€ |
| **Da Enzo al 29** | Trastevere | Legendary cacio e pepe, tiny so book ahead | €€ |
| **Pizzeria ai Marmi** | Trastevere | Locals call it "l'obitorio" (the morgue) because of the marble tables. Thin, crispy Roman pizza. Kids love it | € |
| **Supplizio** | Centro | Street food — supplì (fried rice balls). Quick, cheap, delicious | € |
| **Fatamorgana** | Multiple | Best gelato in Rome, all natural. Trastevere + Spanish Steps locations | € |
| **Dar Poeta** | Trastevere | Pizza with Nutella calzone for dessert. Kids will worship you | € |

**Eating tips:**
- Italians eat dinner late (8–9pm). Restaurants before 7:30pm will be empty — use that to your advantage with kids
- "Coperto" (cover charge) of €1–3pp is normal, not a scam
- Kids' menus are rare in Rome. Just order a half portion (mezza porzione) of pasta — they'll always do it

---

## 3. Naples (3 nights: 28 June–1 July)

### Getting There
**Frecciarossa high-speed train** from Roma Termini → Napoli Centrale
- Journey: ~1h10
- Cost: From €15pp if booked early (kids 4–14 get 50% off on Trenitalia "Bimbi Gratis" family offer — 1 child free per adult on some fares)
- Book on [trenitalia.com](https://trenitalia.com) or [italotreno.com](https://italotreno.com) — Italo often cheaper, from €14.90

### Where to Stay
Stay near **Piazza del Plebiscito** or along the **Lungomare** (seafront). These are safe, walkable, and central.

Avoid: Quartieri Spagnoli at night, Forcella after dark, areas north of the train station.

**Budget:** €100–180/night for a 2-bed apartment

### Safety (Real Talk)
Naples gets a bad rap. The reality:
- **Petty theft/pickpockets** are the main risk — same as any big European city. Use a money belt or zipped bag. Don't flash phones/watches
- **Don't carry valuables in back pockets** — scooter snatch-and-grab is a thing (rare, but it happens)
- **Stick to main streets after dark** with kids — the centro storico and seafront are fine
- **Traffic is chaotic** — hold the kids' hands crossing roads. Zebra crossings are suggestions, not rules
- **It's loud, messy, and brilliant.** Don't expect Rome's polish. That's the charm

### Pizza Pilgrimage 🍕

Naples invented pizza. This is a non-negotiable part of the trip.

| Pizzeria | Style | Queue? | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| **L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele** | Only Margherita or Marinara. Period. | Yes, 30–60 min | The "Eat Pray Love" one. Worth it once. Go at 11:30am to beat the rush |
| **Sorbillo** | Creative toppings, beautiful pies | Yes, 20–40 min | More variety, better for picky kids |
| **50 Kalò** | Modern Neapolitan, lighter dough | Shorter | Slightly upscale, great for a sit-down meal |
| **Da Attilio** | Traditional, fried pizza too | Minimal | Local favourite, less touristy |
| **Starita** | Famous for fried pizza (montanara) | Moderate | The kids will love fried pizza |

**Pro tip:** Pizza in Naples costs €4–8. You'll eat the best pizza of your life for less than a McDonald's.

### What to Do (Beyond Pizza)

- **Naples National Archaeological Museum (MANN)** — This is where all the best Pompeii artefacts ended up. Go here BEFORE Pompeii — it makes the ruins 10x more meaningful. Has mosaics, sculptures, a "Secret Cabinet" of Roman erotica (skip that room with the kids, or don't — it's educational 😅). ~2 hours
- **Spaccanapoli walk** — The street that "splits Naples in two". Walk it end to end: churches, street life, shops, chaos
- **Naples Underground (Napoli Sotterranea)** — Tunnels under the city from Greek and Roman times. Kids absolutely love this. ~90 min guided tour, €12/person
- **Seafront walk** — Lungomare from Castel dell'Ovo to Mergellina. Beautiful at sunset. Grab a sfogliatella (pastry) from a seafront cafe

### Day Trip Options from Naples
- **Pompeii** — see section below (30 min by Circumvesuviana train)
- **Mount Vesuvius** — combine with Pompeii if energy permits. Bus from Pompeii or Ercolano station to the crater. 30-min walk to the summit. Kids should be fine. €10 entry
- **Herculaneum (Ercolano)** — smaller than Pompeii but better preserved. Less walking, less overwhelming for kids. Could substitute for Pompeii if time is short
- **Capri** — 50-min ferry from Naples port. Gorgeous but expensive. Better as a day trip from Amalfi Coast

---

## 4. Pompeii (Day Trip from Naples)

### Logistics
- **Circumvesuviana train** from Napoli Centrale → Pompei Scavi (Villa dei Misteri stop). ~35 min, €3.60pp
- The Circumvesuviana is famously grotty — crowded, hot, no A/C. But it's cheap and direct. Hold bags close
- Alternative: private transfer (~€60–80 each way, much more comfortable for a family of 4)

### How Long to Spend
- **3 hours with a guide** is ideal for kids aged 10–11. Enough to see the highlights without them melting in the heat
- Without a guide, 2–4 hours self-guided. More than 4 hours and kids will be done
- The site is HUGE (170 acres). You won't see everything. Don't try

### Best Time to Visit
- **Get there at opening (9am)** — June heat is brutal by midday (35°C+)
- Avoid afternoons entirely. There is almost NO shade in Pompeii
- Morning visit → lunch in nearby Pompei town → afternoon at hotel/pool

### Tips for Kids
- **Book a family-friendly guide** — A good guide makes Pompeii come alive for kids. They'll talk about gladiators, food stalls, toilet habits. ~€150–200 for a 3-hour private family tour (worth every cent)
- **Bring: water (lots), sunscreen, hats, comfortable shoes** — The ground is uneven cobblestones. No flip-flops
- **Highlights kids will love:**
  - The plaster casts of the victims (haunting but fascinating — the kids are old enough)
  - The amphitheatre
  - The thermopolium (ancient fast-food counter)
  - The bakery with millstones
  - The "Cave Canem" (Beware of Dog) mosaic
- **No pushchairs** — terrain is too rough
- **Tickets:** €18 adults; EU under-18 free (check if UK kids still qualify post-Brexit); otherwise €2 reduced. Book online at [ticketone.it](https://www.ticketone.it) or the official Pompeii site

## 5. Amalfi Coast (9 nights: 1–10 July)

### Where to Base Yourselves

**Recommended: Sorrento or Amalfi town**

| Base | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Sorrento** | Best transport links (train + bus + ferry), most amenities, slightly cheaper, easy access to Capri & Pompeii | Can feel touristy, not technically on the Amalfi Coast |
| **Amalfi** | Central to the coast, good ferry connections, atmospheric | Fewer apartment options for families, busy in peak season |
| **Positano** | Most beautiful town, Instagram-perfect | Extremely steep (hundreds of steps with kids = tears), very expensive, limited transport |
| **Minori/Maiori** | Quieter, better beaches, more affordable | Less glamorous, fewer restaurants |

**My recommendation:** Base in **Amalfi town** or **Minori** (10 min bus from Amalfi). Amalfi is central for ferries and buses. Minori is quieter with a better beach and lower prices. Either works brilliantly for 9 nights.

**Budget:** €120–250/night for a 2-bed apartment. Book early — Amalfi Coast in July is peak season.

### Getting Around

1. **SITA buses** — The main coast road bus. €2.20 per ride or **€10 for a 24-hour unlimited pass** (CostieraSita). Buses run frequently in summer but are PACKED. Get on at the start of the route if possible
2. **Ferries** — TravelMar and NLG run services between Salerno, Amalfi, Positano, Capri, and Sorrento. More expensive but infinitely more pleasant. ~€8–15pp per journey. No booking needed, just turn up
3. **Private boat hire** — Splurge option: rent a gozzo (small boat) with a skipper for a day (~€300–500). Explore hidden coves, swim off the boat. Kids will remember this forever
4. **Don't rent a car** — The coast road is a single-lane nightmare of hairpin bends and buses. Parking is impossible and expensive. Trust me on this

### Towns to Visit

**Positano** (day trip)
- Walk down through the town (it's all stairs), shop the boutiques, hit Spiaggia Grande beach
- Lunch at **Da Vincenzo** or grab a takeaway pizza and eat on the beach
- Take the ferry back — the view of Positano from the water is the postcard shot
- Allow a full day

**Ravello** (half day)
- Hill town above Amalfi, ~25 min by bus. Cooler, quieter, stunning gardens
- **Villa Rufolo** — beautiful gardens with coast views. Often has concerts in summer (Ravello Festival runs late June–mid July — check for family-appropriate performances!)
- **Villa Cimbrone** — the "Terrace of Infinity" viewpoint. Genuinely jaw-dropping
- Less interesting for kids than the coast towns, but a nice change of pace

**Amalfi** (you're staying here)
- Cathedral of St Andrew (Duomo) — dramatic striped facade, free to admire from outside
- Paper Museum — Amalfi was a major paper producer. Small museum, mildly interesting for kids
- Walk the **Valle delle Ferriere** trail from Amalfi — riverside walk through lemon groves. Moderate, good for kids
- Wander, eat, gelato, repeat

**Atrani** (10 min walk from Amalfi)
- Tiny fishing village, one of the smallest towns in Italy. Feels undiscovered. Small beach
- Lunch at **Le Arcate** — tables right on the beach, fresh seafood, reasonable prices

### Beaches

| Beach | Where | Type | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| **Spiaggia Grande** | Positano | Sand | The main one. Beautiful but crowded in July. Lounger + umbrella ~€20–30/day |
| **Fornillo Beach** | Positano | Pebble/sand | Quieter alternative, 10-min walk from Spiaggia Grande |
| **Marina Grande** | Amalfi | Sand/pebble | Town beach, convenient if based in Amalfi |
| **Minori Beach** | Minori | Sand | Best family beach on the coast — wider, sandier, calmer water. Free sections available |
| **Maiori Beach** | Maiori | Sand | Longest beach on the Amalfi Coast. Good for kids |
| **Arienzo Beach** | Near Positano | Pebble | 300 steps down (or take the shuttle boat). Worth it for the seclusion |
| **Duoglio Beach** | Near Amalfi | Pebble | Quieter, reach by stairs or boat from Amalfi |

**Beach tips:**
- Most beaches charge for loungers/umbrellas (€15–30/set per day). Free sections exist but get taken early
- Water shoes are essential — many beaches are pebbly
- The water is crystal clear and calm in summer. Kids can swim safely in most spots
- Bring snorkelling gear — even basic masks reveal fish along the rocks

### Day Trips from the Amalfi Coast

- **Capri** — Ferry from Amalfi or Sorrento (~€20pp each way). Blue Grotto (extra €18pp — tourist trap but kids love the neon blue water), chairlift to Monte Solaro, swimming at Marina Piccola. Full day
- **Sorrento** — If based in Amalfi, worth a day trip. Limoncello tasting, cliff-top views, better shopping
- **Path of the Gods (Sentiero degli Dei)** — Famous coastal hike from Bomerano to Positano. 7.8km, 3–4 hours, moderate difficulty. Stunning views. Connie and Evie can handle it, but bring water and snacks. Take the bus to Bomerano, hike to Nocelle, bus/steps to Positano

## 6. Practical Information

### Flights from Jakarta

No direct flights from CGK to Italy. Best options:

| Airline | Route | Stops | Approx. Flight Time | Price Range (family of 4, return) |
|---------|-------|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Qatar Airways** | CGK → DOH → FCO/NAP | 1 (Doha) | ~16–18h total | $4,000–6,000 |
| **Emirates** | CGK → DXB → FCO/NAP | 1 (Dubai) | ~17–19h | $4,000–6,000 |
| **Turkish Airlines** | CGK → IST → FCO/NAP | 1 (Istanbul) | ~18–20h | $3,500–5,500 |
| **Etihad** | CGK → AUH → FCO | 1 (Abu Dhabi) | ~17–19h | $3,800–5,500 |
| **Singapore Airlines** | CGK → SIN → FCO | 1 (Singapore) | ~17–19h | $4,500–7,000 |

**Recommendations:**
- **Fly into Rome (FCO), fly out of Naples (NAP)** — avoids backtracking. One-way tickets or open-jaw bookings. Check Qatar and Turkish for this option
- Qatar and Turkish typically have the best value for families. Emirates is more comfortable but pricier
- **Book by March 2026** for best prices — June/July is peak season, prices climb from April onwards
- If Sinead prefers: Singapore Airlines via SIN is the most comfortable option but usually the priciest

### Visa & Entry Requirements

- **UK passport holders:** No visa needed for Italy (Schengen zone) for stays up to **90 days in any 180-day period**
- **ETIAS:** The EU's new travel authorisation system is expected to launch **Q4 2026** (October onwards). Your June trip should NOT require ETIAS — but monitor this. If it launches earlier than expected, it's €7pp (free for under-18s), valid 3 years, applied online
- **Passport validity:** Must be valid for at least **3 months beyond your departure date from Italy** and issued within the last 10 years. Check all 4 passports now
- **Dee's passport:** If Dee is on an Indonesian passport, he WILL need a Schengen visa. Apply at the Italian embassy in Jakarta 3–6 months before travel. If Dee is on a UK passport, same rules as above apply
- **Post-Brexit:** UK citizens now get passport stamped on entry/exit. No more EU fast lane. Allow extra time at immigration

### Travel Insurance

Essential. Get a policy that covers:
- Medical expenses (minimum €1M — Italian hospitals are good but costs add up)
- Trip cancellation/curtailment
- Baggage loss
- Personal liability
- Activities: hiking, swimming, boat trips

**Options:**
- **World Nomads** — flexible, covers adventurous activities, good for families. ~$200–350 for 3 weeks, family of 4
- **Allianz Global Assistance** — solid all-rounder, available from Indonesia
- **SafetyWing** — nomad-oriented, cheaper but less comprehensive
- If you have UK-issued travel insurance or credit card coverage, check what it includes first

### SIM Cards / Connectivity

**Best option: Buy a local Italian SIM on arrival**

| Provider | Tourist Plan | Data | Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|------|-------|
| **Vodafone** | Vodafone Tourist | 200GB | ~€15 | Best deal. Available at airports and Vodafone stores |
| **TIM** | TIM Tourist | 100GB + calls | ~€20–30 | Widest coverage, especially in rural areas |
| **WindTre** | Tourist plans | Varies | ~€10–20 | Good value, decent coverage |

**Alternative:** Get an **eSIM** before you go (if phones support it). Airalo or Holafly offer Italy eSIMs from ~$10 for 5GB/7 days. Convenient but less data than a local SIM.

**Pro tip:** Buy one Italian SIM for data, hotspot to the family's devices. Saves buying 4 SIMs.

### Budget Estimate (3 weeks, family of 4)

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Flights** | $4,500–6,000 | Return, family of 4, economy. Book early |
| **Accommodation** | €2,800–4,500 | 21 nights across 3 locations. Apartments, not hotels |
| **Food** | €2,100–3,000 | ~€100–140/day family of 4. Mix of restaurants and self-catering |
| **Transport in Italy** | €400–600 | Trains (Rome→Naples ~€80 family), buses, ferries, occasional taxi |
| **Activities & entrance fees** | €500–800 | Museums, tours, guides, boat trips |
| **Miscellaneous** | €300–500 | SIM cards, gelato fund, beach loungers, souvenirs |
| **TOTAL** | **~€7,000–10,000** | **~$7,500–11,000 / ~£6,000–8,500** |

This assumes comfortable-but-not-luxury travel: decent apartments, eating out most meals, doing the main sights, occasional splurge (boat trip, cooking class).

### Don't Forget

- [ ] Check all 4 passports are valid (3 months beyond 13 July = valid until at least 13 October 2026)
- [ ] Monitor ETIAS launch date — if it launches before June, you'll need to register online
- [ ] Inform your bank about travel dates (avoid card blocks)
- [ ] Download offline maps (Google Maps / Maps.me) for the Amalfi Coast — signal can be patchy
- [ ] Pack: water shoes, sun hats, reef-safe sunscreen, universal power adapter (Type C/F/L for Italy)
- [ ] Get the Trenitalia and Moovit apps for transport
- [ ] Pack light — apartment laundry means you can wash clothes. Cobblestones + big suitcases = misery
