Scan with your phone.\n\n2. **Update .env** to enable WhatsApp:\n   ```\n   ENABLE_WHATSAPP=true   # (or just remove the line)\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart NanoClaw**\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- ✅ Safe: The code already handles both platforms\n- ✅ Safe: WhatsApp and Telegram use separate registrations\n- ⚠️ Note: You'll need a way to display the QR code (Chromebook might need special handling)\n\nWant me to proceed with the WhatsApp authentication? I'll need you to be able to see a QR code in the terminal.",

When NanoClaw connects, it kicks out WhatsApp Web (and vice versa). They keep fighting over the connection - that's the \"conflict: replaced\" error I saw.\n\n**Your Options:**\n\n1. **Use a separate WhatsApp number for NanoClaw** (recommended for Indonesia business)\n   - Get a cheap local SIM just for the bot\n   - Your main number stays free for WhatsApp Web\n   - Best for production use\n\n2. **Use WhatsApp Web normally, disable NanoClaw WhatsApp**\n   - Keep `ENABLE_WHATSAPP=false` \n   - Use Telegram for NanoClaw communication\n   - Your work WhatsApp stays unaffected\n\n3. **Time-share** (not recommended)\n   - Only one can be active at a time\n   - Annoying for daily use\n\n**My Recommendation:**\nFor WA Indonesia, get a second SIM card. They're cheap and it gives you a dedicated bot number. Your work WhatsApp stays completely separate.\n\nWant me to keep WhatsApp disabled for now while you sort out a second number? Or do you want to test it with your current number (knowing it'll kick out WhatsApp Web)?",

The \"conflict: replaced\" error I saw might be something else - maybe the auth was done in a way that conflicts, or it was authenticating during the same session repeatedly.\n\nLet me try again properly. The auth actually succeeded earlier (it said \"Successfully authenticated\"), but then when we started NanoClaw it kept reconnecting in a loop.\n\nLet's test it now:\n\n```bash\ncd /home/dieterwerwath/nanoclaw\npkill -f \"node dist/index\"\nENABLE_WHATSAPP=true TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8571291784:AAFI7ZLOc9PltP2uRRDMpjBIXRKrZk8sgbo node dist/index.js\n```\n\nRun this and watch the output.

Here's how:\n\n1. **Create a self-chat:**\n   - Save your own number as a contact (e.g., \"Note to Self\")\n   - Open WhatsApp and start a chat with that contact\n   - This creates a private chat where only you can see messages\n\n2. **Register it as your main WhatsApp channel:**\n   I need to register this chat as your \"main\" channel so I respond to ALL messages (not just @Torque mentions).\n\n**To set this up, I need the JID (WhatsApp ID) of your self-chat.** \n\nSend me a message from that self-chat (just say \"hi\" with @Torque) and I'll be able to see the JID in the logs, then register it properly.\n\nOr, if you prefer a different setup (like a group with just you), let me know!",

Messages appear as a conversation between you and the bot.\n\n**WhatsApp:** There's no \"bot account\". NanoClaw uses YOUR WhatsApp account (via linked devices), so all messages appear to come from you. It's like you're talking to yourself.\n\n**Possible workarounds:**\n\n1. **Use a second phone number** (best solution)\n   - Get a cheap SIM, register it on WhatsApp\n   - NanoClaw uses that number\n   - You chat with it like a normal contact\n   - Messages show as a real 2-way conversation\n\n2. **Use WhatsApp Business API** (complex, requires business verification)\n   - Official API for businesses\n   - Bot gets its own identity\n   - Requires Meta approval, costs money\n\n3. **Accept the limitation**\n   - Use WhatsApp only for @Torque commands in groups\n   - Use Telegram for your main 2-way conversation with me\n\n**My recommendation:** Use Telegram as your \"command center\" (like now), and WhatsApp for @Torque commands in your Indonesia work groups. That way both platforms serve their purpose.\n\nWhat do you prefer?",

This is persistent \"long-term memory\"\n- **Conversation archives** - When sessions get too long, they're compacted but archived to `conversations/` folder\n\n⚠️ **Current limitation:** If my session gets compacted (too long), I may lose details. The fix is writing important context to CLAUDE.md.\n\n**2) Can you ask me to research overnight?**\n\nYes! I can schedule a task:\n```\n\"At 7am, research X and send me a summary\"\n```\n\nThe task runs as a fresh session, does the research, and messages you the results.\n\n**Want me to:**\n- Write a summary of today's setup to CLAUDE.md so I remember?\n- Schedule a research task for morning?\n\nSleep well! 🌙 Message me whenever you're back.",

The token expiry is a separate issue - just run `/login` in your terminal to refresh it. NanoClaw uses its own OAuth credentials stored in the `.env` file, so they don't conflict.\n\n**2. Knowing if I'm working in the background**\nGreat point! Right now there's no visibility. Ideas:\n- I could send a \"Working on it...\" message when I start processing\n- We could add a status indicator somewhere\n- Set up a simple webhook/notification\n\n**3. Media Support Update**\nI just finished implementing image & voice note support! Here's what's working:\n- 📷 Images automatically download when you send them\n- 🎤 Voice notes get saved too\n- 📄 Documents, videos, audio files - all supported\n- I can now VIEW images you send me!\n\n**Try it:** Send me a photo and I'll describe what I see!\n\nWhat would you like to tackle first - the visibility issue or testing the media features?",

That's actually a good segue into your visibility question!\n\n**About the OAuth error:**\nYou CAN use Claude Code manually while NanoClaw runs - they don't share tokens. The error means your main Claude Code token expired. Just run `/login` in terminal to refresh it. NanoClaw uses separate credentials from `.env`.\n\n**Visibility when I'm working:**\nYou're right this is a problem. Options:\n1. **Quick fix:** I send \"🔄 Working on it...\" when I start processing\n2. **Better:** Add a status file I update that you could check\n3. **Best:** Webhook/notification when I start & finish\n\nWhich approach appeals to you?\n\n**Media support is live!** \nSend me a photo or voice note and I'll describe it - that feature is ready to test now!",

Google AI Studio gives you a key instantly\n**2. Which models for what?**\nHere's my recommendation:\n\n```| Task                              | Model      | Why                                             |\n| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Orchestration (me talking to you) | Opus       | Best reasoning, worth the cost for coordination |\n| Coding sub-agents                 | Sonnet 4   | 95% as good at code, 1/5 the price              |\n| Quick lookups, summaries          | Haiku      | Fast, dirt cheap                                |\n| Long context (100k+)              | Gemini 2.5 | Handles huge files well                         |\n| Fallback/comparison               | GPT-4.1    | Good second opinion                             |\n```\n**3. Your involvement**\nTotally. Two approaches:\n\n**A) Auto-routing** - I pick based on task type (coding → Sonnet, research → Haiku, etc.)\n\n**B) Explicit** - You tell me: \"use Sonnet for this\" or \"spawn a cheap agent\"\n\n**What we need from you:**\n\n• Do you want to grab a Gemini API key? (Free, 2 min at ai.google.dev)\n• Want OpenAI too, or stick with Anthropic + Google for now?\nThe Anthropic family alone (Opus + Sonnet + Haiku) covers 90% of use cases.

Not lecturing, just noting: this is exactly why the \"systems for yourself\" conversation matters.\n\n**Good news:** I did my homework while you slept.\n\nCheck out: `OVERNIGHT-2026-02-05.md` in your workspace\n\nIt has:\n\n• Questions to help me understand Candid better\n• 5 ideas based on what I found in your repos\n• Financial analysis from budget-data.js (your gross margin is 🔥 but OpEx is eating gains)\nWhen you're caffeinated and ready, take a look and let's talk.\n\nNo rush.

Let me break this down:\n\n**Your constraints:**\n\n• ADHD-adjacent brain = needs LOW friction\n• Already deep in Google ecosystem\n• Patchy Jakarta internet\n• Want me to have access\n• Ryan on Obsidian (shared learning opportunity)\n\nRight Now (Lowest Friction)\n\n**Stick with Google Drive for sharing docs with me.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n• You're already there\n• I can work with it if you share folders\n• No migration, no new tool to learn\n• Just drop docs in a shared folder, I read them\n**For the immediate need:** Create a shared folder, give Linux access, done.\n\n\nMedium Term (Worth Considering)\n\n**Obsidian has legs for you:**\n\n• Files are just `.md` (markdown) — I can read/write them directly\n• Store in your workspace folder → version controlled with Git\n• Local-first = works when Jakarta internet dies\n• Graph view helps visualize your \"100 ideas in stasis\"\n• Ryan's on it = you can compare notes, share learnings\n**The key insight:** Obsidian isn't really an \"app\" — it's just a nice interface for a folder of text files. If you put that folder in `~/.openclaw/workspace/notes/`, I have full access. No API needed.\n\n\nLonger Term Ideal\n\nA system where:\n\n• Notes live in markdown in your workspace\n• Git-backed (auto-versioned)\n• Obsidian for your UI (desktop + mobile)\n• I can search, surface, and even add to your notes\n• Synced via Git or Obsidian Sync\n\nMy Recommendation\n\n1. **Today:** Share Google Drive folders with Linux. I'll read your existing docs.\n2. **This week/next:** Try Obsidian with vault in workspace folder. Low risk — it's just files.\n3. **If it clicks:** Migrate key docs over time. No rush.\nWant me to set up an Obsidian-ready folder structure in the workspace while you share the Google Drive stuff?",

That's your safety net there.\n2. **Workspace files** — Yes! I've already been doing this. Overnight I committed all the memory files and OVERNIGHT doc. I can continue committing regularly.\n**If you want to Git-track important docs:** We'd copy them from Drive → workspace folder → then Git tracks changes. The Drive version stays as source of truth, workspace copy is versioned.\n\n\n**On Obsidian + Chromebook:**\n\nIt works! Two options:\n\n• **Linux app** — Install in your Linux container (Crostini)\n• **Android app** — Via Play Store on Chromebook\n**The pitch for you:**\n\n• Notes are just `.md` files in a folder\n• I can read/write/search them directly\n• Works offline (Jakarta internet)\n• Links between notes (connect your 100 ideas)\n• Graph view to visualize connections\n**But honestly:** If Google Docs is working for you and you're not feeling the pull, no rush.

Future-proofed.\n\n2. **Mac Mini sync later:** YES, zero problem. Obsidian vault = just a folder of `.md` files. Move it, Git it, Dropbox it, whatever. No lock-in.\n\n**TODAY:**\n\n3. **Cherry-pick critical docs** — Export the key ones (Strategy doc, Initial Plan, etc.) as **Markdown** (better than PDF — I can actually work with text). Google Docs → File → Download → Markdown (.md)\n\n**THIS WEEK:**\n\n4. **GAS script for bulk export** — Yes, this is doable! GAS can:  • Loop through folder\n  • Export each doc as PDF or (better) convert to Markdown\n  • Save to a specific Drive folder that syncs to Linux\nCan't write directly to Linux, but can write to Drive → auto-syncs.\n\n**Want me to:**\n\nA) Create the Obsidian vault structure in workspace now?\nB) Give you the quick install command for Obsidian on Linux?\nC) Draft the GAS export script for later?\n\nAll of the above? 🔧",

The canonical code is in `candid-labs/0. PLATFORM/0.1 Vault/`.\n\nWant me to continue reading through those spokes, or do you have specific priorities given what Codex already found?",

If it's looking for an `@` tag, WhatsApp groups work differently than Discord/Slack. The \"mention\" might not be detected the way you expect.\n\n3. **Bot name matching** — Whatever name you're calling out (\"Candid AI\", \"Candid Assistant\") needs to match what your assistant is listening for. Check your config for `aliases` or mention patterns.\n\n4. **Logs** — If you can check your assistant's logs, that'll show if it's receiving the messages but not triggering, or not receiving them at all.\n\nWhat platform is your assistant running on? OpenClaw, something custom?\n\nThis is from Ryan's agent.\n\nNote.. You don't seem to be replying to my own DM on WA now...",

Candid Labs (platform + site)**\nI'll review what's in the repos and [ROADMAP.md](http://roadmap.md/), identify what's actionable, and spawn sub-agents on specific tasks. I'll have a summary + progress for you when you're back.\n\n**3. WhatsApp silent monitoring research**\nI'll dig into OpenClaw docs for \"listen-only\" mode — probably something like `requireMention: true` with no matching patterns, or a specific config flag. Will document findings and prep for testing with your friend group.\n\n\n**What I need from you before you go:**\nJust the Zoom recording location for task 1. The rest I can start on now.\n\nGo crush your meetings — I'll have updates waiting. ⚙️",

And that's at FULL rollout — ramp from 400→2000 outlets means Year 1 effective average is lower.\n\nWhat's realistic based on similar products? If a minimarket sells even a few drinks/day containing your mixers, they'd reorder more than monthly.\n\nGo play — I'll add this note to the doc. We can stress-test the assumptions later.",

Here's what I can do:\n\n**Creating visuals:**\n\n• ✅ HTML dashboards (like your existing `budget.html`)\n• ✅ SVG graphics, charts, gauges\n• ✅ Mermaid diagrams (Gantt, flowcharts, etc.)\n• ❌ Can't generate images like DALL-E/Midjourney\n**Sharing back to you:**\n\n1. **Canvas** — I can render HTML directly to your screen (works on desktop/phone)\n2. **File drop** — Save to workspace folder you can sync/access\n3. **Web preview** — If we set up a simple local server, dashboards become URLs\nFor quick visual feedback, Canvas is probably the fastest path — I render it, you see it immediately in Telegram or browser.\n\n**For your Mindstacks/Claude examples:** Yeah, share those! Drop images here or to the OpenClaw file sharing folder. I can see images sent through Telegram and can analyze them to understand the style you're after — then replicate in HTML/SVG.\n\nWant me to show you a quick dashboard mockup via Canvas to test the flow?",

If the custom view sticks, we expand. If you stop looking at it after 2 weeks, Looker's still there.\n\nWant me to build a single **\"Candid Daily Cockpit\"** page as the test case?

Or does that fall under Ops?\n• **Customer Success** — post-sale relationships? Or part of Sales?\nFor MVP, I'd suggest starting with:\n\n1. **PA** (high use — daily)\n2. **Finance** (budget season)\n3. **Sales Ops** (revenue is king)\n4. **gas-dev** (unblock the data work)\n5. **frontend** (dashboards)\nThe others can spin up when needed.

I receive a message: \"Read [HEARTBEAT.md](http://heartbeat.md/)... do what it says\"\n3. I check `HEARTBEAT.md` for tasks\n4.

No point having structure if adding tasks is friction.\n\n**Phased approach:**\n\nPhase 1: Telegram Input (MVP — works now)\n\nYou message me with a format:\n\n```task: Deploy tiered fork\nfor: gas-dev\npriority: high\n```\nI (or PA/taskmaster) parse it, add to the right file, confirm.\n\n**Pros:** Works immediately, no new tools\n**Cons:** Requires me to be awake / parse correctly\n\n\nPhase 2: Form on Dashboard\n\nSimple form on the GitHub Pages site:\n\n```[ Task description    ]\n[ Assignee ▼ ] [ Priority ▼ ]\n[ Submit ]\n```\nSubmits via:\n\n• **GitHub Actions** — form triggers workflow, commits to repo\n• **Or webhook** — POST to a serverless function (Cloudflare Worker, etc.)\n**Pros:** Clean UX, works from phone\n**Cons:** Needs backend setup\n\n\nPhase 3: Multi-input\n\n• Telegram: quick capture\n• Form: structured input\n• Voice: \"Hey Torque, add a task...\"\n• All feed same `tasks.json`\n\n**Taskmaster agent role:**\n\n• Owns task processing\n• Validates inputs\n• Routes to correct assignee\n• Updates files\n• Notifies on changes\n\n**Quick win for tonight:**\nWant me to set up the Telegram input pattern now?

There's no handoff from \"active session where I committed to something\" → \"heartbeat session where I should pick it up.\"\n\nWhat would actually work: a `WIP.md` (work in progress) that I write to __during__ a session when I start something, and that heartbeat checks to resume or flag stalled work.\n\nBut honestly — is that just another file I'll forget to update?

Cron jobs can:\n\n• Run at exact times\n• Have different intervals for different tasks\n• Target isolated sessions (cheaper)\n• Fire one-shot reminders\nSo if we wanted, say, \"check email every hour but check tasks every 15 min\" — that's multiple cron jobs, not heartbeat.\n\nDoes that match what you were thinking, or were you heading somewhere else?",

A `WIP.md` or `state.json` — what am I working on, what did I promise\n2. Heartbeat checks that file FIRST — \"was I in the middle of something?\"\n3. Then checks a short list of real priorities\nThen layer on:\n\n• **Heartbeat (30 min):** General awareness — check WIP, check urgent flags\n• **Cron (specific times):** Defined deliverables — \"7am morning summary\", \"remind me at X\"\nWithout state tracking, more rules just means more things I'll forget to follow.\n\nWant to build the state tracking first?",

Main session heartbeat then just reviews that and decides. But that's over-engineering for now.\n\n**Simpler answer:** 15m heartbeat is light enough.

Then configure it through `openclaw config` wizard\n**Key lesson:** Model switches can break auth. The correct fix was:\n\n```claude setup-token  # generates OAuth token for MAX subscription\nopenclaw config     # wizard → Model → Anthropic token → paste\n```\n**I'm noting this for future:**\n\n• Don't use `session_status(model=...)` for model changes\n• MAX subscription uses OAuth tokens, not API keys\n• If auth breaks: regenerate via `claude setup-token`\nAre we stable now?

Smart for context limits.\n4. **Manuel's chaos** — \"spawned 3 sub agents to do other work\" — so sub-agents spawning sub-agents is a thing. 😅\nThe Gatsby table confirms multi-model is achievable. We just need:\n\n• Separate API key (pay-per-use) for Sonnet/Haiku\n• Configure it as a profile\n• Point subagents to use that profile\nWant me to draft what the config change would look like based on the schema we pulled?

A system where 10 AI agents work together like a real team. If you want to replicate this setup, this guide covers everything.\nIf you're already familiar with Clawdbot (now OpenClaw), you might be thinking \"wait, can't I just run multiple Clawdbots?\" Yes. That's exactly what this is. This guide shows you how.\nPart 1: Why I Built This\nThe Problem With AI Assistants\nI run @SiteGPT, an AI chatbot for customer support. I use AI constantly. But every AI tool I tried had the same problem. No continuity.\nEvery conversation started fresh. Context from yesterday? Gone. That research I asked for last week? Lost in some chat thread I'd never find again.\nI wanted something different. Agents that remember what they're working on. Multiple agents with different skills working together. A shared workspace where all context lives. The ability to assign tasks and track progress.\nBasically, I wanted AI to work like a team, not like a search box.\nThe Starting Point: Clawdbot\nI was already using Clawdbot. It's an open-source AI agent framework that runs as a persistent daemon. It connects to Claude (or other models) and gives the AI access to tools like file system, shell commands, web browsing, and more.\nOne Clawdbot instance gave me one AI assistant (Jarvis) connected to Telegram. Useful, but limited.\nThen I had a thought. What if I ran multiple Clawdbot sessions, each with its own personality and context?\nThat's when I realized the architecture was already there. I just needed to orchestrate it.\nPart 2: Understanding Clawdbot Architecture (The Foundation)\nIf you're going to build a multi-agent system, you need to understand how Clawdbot works under the hood. This is the foundation everything else builds on.\nWhat Is Clawdbot?\nClawdbot (now called OpenClaw) is an AI agent framework with three main jobs:\nFirst, it connects AI models to the real world. File access, shell commands, web browsing, APIs.\nSecond, it maintains persistent sessions. Conversation history that survives restarts.\nThird, it routes messages. Connect the AI to Telegram, Discord, Slack, or any channel.\nIt runs as a daemon (background service) on a server, listening for messages and responding.\nThe Gateway\nThe Gateway is the core process. It runs 24/7 on your server. It manages all active sessions. It handles cron jobs (scheduled tasks). It routes messages between channels and sessions. It provides a WebSocket API for control.\nStart it with:\nbash\nclawdbot gateway start\nConfiguration lives in a JSON file. You define which AI provider and model to use (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.), which channels to connect (Telegram, Discord, etc.), what tools agents can access, and default system prompts and workspace paths.\nSessions: The Key Concept\nA session is a persistent conversation with context.\nEvery session has a session key (unique identifier, like agent:main:main), conversation history (stored as JSONL files on disk), a model (which AI to use), and tools (what the AI can access).\nHere's the important part. Sessions are independent. Each session has its own history, its own context, its own \"memory\" of past conversations.\nWhen you run multiple agents, you're really running multiple sessions. Each with their own identity.\nHow Sessions Work\nplaintext\nUser sends message to Telegram\n        ↓\nGateway receives it\n        ↓\nGateway routes to correct session (based on config)\n        ↓\nSession loads conversation history\n        ↓\nAI generates response (with full context)\n        ↓\nResponse sent back through Telegram\n        ↓\nHistory updated and saved to disk\nSessions can be main sessions (long-running, interactive, like chatting with Jarvis) or isolated sessions (one-shot, for cron jobs, wake up, do task, done).",

      "text": "Cron Jobs: Scheduled Agent Wakeups\nClawdbot has a built-in cron system. You can schedule tasks:\nbash\nclawdbot cron add \\\n  --name \"morning-check\" \\\n  --cron \"30 7 * * *\" \\\n  --message \"Check today's calendar and send me a summary\"\nWhen a cron fires, the Gateway creates or wakes a session, sends the message to the AI, the AI responds (can use tools, send messages, etc.), and the session can persist or terminate.\nThis is how agents \"wake up\" periodically without being always-on.\nThe Workspace\nEvery Clawdbot instance has a workspace. That's a directory on disk where configuration files live, memory files are stored, scripts and tools are accessible, and the AI can read and write files.\nThe workspace is how agents persist information between sessions. They write to files. Those files survive restarts.\nplaintext\n/home/usr/clawd/           ← Workspace root\n├── AGENTS.md              ← Instructions for agents\n├── SOUL.md                ← Agent personality\n├── memory/\n│   ├── WORKING.md         ← Current task state\n│   ├── 2026-01-31.md      ← Daily notes\n│   └── ...\n├── scripts/               ← Utilities agents can run\n└── config/                ← Credentials, settings\nPart 3: From One Clawdbot to Ten Agents\nNow you understand the foundation. Here's how I built a team.\nThe Insight\nClawdbot sessions are independent. Each can have its own personality (via SOUL.md), its own memory files, its own cron schedule, its own tools and access.\nSo each agent is just a Clawdbot session with a specialized configuration.\nJarvis isn't special. He's a session with session key agent:main:main, a SOUL.md that says \"You are Jarvis, the squad lead...\", access to all tools, and a connection to my Telegram.\nShuri is another session with session key agent:product-analyst:main, a SOUL.md that says \"You are Shuri, the product analyst...\", the same tools (file access, shell, browser), and her own heartbeat cron.\nTen agents equals ten sessions. Each waking up on their own schedule. Each with their own context.\nSession Keys: Agent Identity\nEach agent has a unique session key:\nplaintext\nagent:main:main              → Jarvis (Squad Lead)\nagent:product-analyst:main   → Shuri\nagent:customer-researcher:main → Fury\nagent:seo-analyst:main       → Vision\nagent:content-writer:main    → Loki\nagent:social-media-manager:main → Quill\nagent:designer:main          → Wanda\nagent:email-marketing:main   → Pepper\nagent:developer:main         → Friday\nagent:notion-agent:main      → Wong\nWhen I send a message to a specific session, only that agent receives it. Their histories are separate.\nCron Jobs: The Heartbeat\nEach agent has a cron job that wakes them every 15 minutes:\nbash\n# Pepper wakes at :00, :15, :30, :45\nclawdbot cron add \\\n  --name \"pepper-mission-control-check\" \\\n  --cron \"0,15,30,45 * * * *\" \\\n  --session \"isolated\" \\\n  --message \"You are Pepper, the Email Marketing Specialist. Check Mission Control for new tasks...\"\nThe schedule is staggered so agents don't all wake at once:\n:00 Pepper\n:02 Shuri\n:04 Friday\n:06 Loki\n:07 Wanda\n:08 Vision\n:10 Fury\n:12 Quill\nEach cron creates an isolated session. It runs, does its job, and terminates. This keeps costs down.\nAgents Talking to Each Other\nHere's where it gets interesting. How do agents communicate?\nOption 1 is direct session messaging:\nbash\nclawdbot sessions send --session \"agent:seo-analyst:main\" --message \"Vision, can you review this?\"\nJarvis can send messages directly to Vision's session.\nOption 2 is a shared database (Mission Control). All agents read and write to the same Convex database. When Fury posts a comment, everyone can see it.\nWe use Option 2 primarily. It creates a shared record of all communication.\nPart 4: The Shared Brain (Mission Control)\nTen independent Clawdbot sessions can work. But without coordination, it's chaos. That's why I built Mission Control.",

      "text": "What Mission Control Does\nMission Control is the shared infrastructure that turns independent agents into a team.\nIt provides a shared task database where everyone sees the same tasks. Comment threads where agents discuss work in one place. An activity feed for real-time visibility into what's happening. A notification system where @mentions alert specific agents. And document storage where deliverables live in a shared repo.\nThink of it as the \"office\" where all agents work. Each agent is still a separate Clawdbot session, but they're all looking at the same whiteboard.\nWhy Convex?\nI chose Convex for the database because it's real-time (changes propagate instantly, when Loki posts a comment, the UI updates live), serverless (no database to manage), TypeScript-native (type safety throughout), and has a generous free tier (more than enough for this scale).\nThe Schema\nSix tables power everything:\njavascript\nagents: {\n  name: string,           // \"Shuri\"\n  role: string,           // \"Product Analyst\"\n  status: \"idle\" | \"active\" | \"blocked\",\n  currentTaskId: Id<\"tasks\">,\n  sessionKey: string,     // \"agent:product-analyst:main\"\n}\n\ntasks: {\n  title: string,\n  description: string,\n  status: \"inbox\" | \"assigned\" | \"in_progress\" | \"review\" | \"done\",\n  assigneeIds: Id<\"agents\">[],\n}\n\nmessages: {\n  taskId: Id<\"tasks\">,\n  fromAgentId: Id<\"agents\">,\n  content: string,        // The comment text\n  attachments: Id<\"documents\">[],\n}\n\nactivities: {\n  type: \"task_created\" | \"message_sent\" | \"document_created\" | ...,\n  agentId: Id<\"agents\">,\n  message: string,\n}\n\ndocuments: {\n  title: string,\n  content: string,        // Markdown\n  type: \"deliverable\" | \"research\" | \"protocol\" | ...,\n  taskId: Id<\"tasks\">,    // If attached to a task\n}\n\nnotifications: {\n  mentionedAgentId: Id<\"agents\">,\n  content: string,\n  delivered: boolean,\n}\nAgents interact with this via Convex CLI commands:\nbash\n# Post a comment\nnpx convex run messages:create '{\"taskId\": \"...\", \"content\": \"Here's my research...\"}'\n\n# Create a document\nnpx convex run documents:create '{\"title\": \"...\", \"content\": \"...\", \"type\": \"deliverable\"}'\n\n# Update task status\nnpx convex run tasks:update '{\"id\": \"...\", \"status\": \"review\"}'\nThe Mission Control UI\nI built a React frontend that displays all this data.\nThere's an Activity Feed showing a real-time stream of everything happening. A Task Board with Kanban columns (Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Review → Done). Agent Cards showing the status of each agent and what they're working on. A Document Panel to read and create deliverables. And a Detail View where you can expand any task to see full context and comments.\nThe aesthetic is intentionally warm and editorial. Like a newspaper dashboard. I spend hours looking at this, so it should feel good.\nPart 5: The SOUL System (Agent Personalities)\nEach agent needs to know who they are. That's the SOUL file.\nWhat's in a SOUL\nmarkdown\n# SOUL.md — Who You Are\n\n**Name:** Shuri\n**Role:** Product Analyst\n\n## Personality\nSkeptical tester. Thorough bug hunter. Finds edge cases.\nThink like a first-time user. Question everything.\nBe specific. Don't just say \"nice work.\"\n\n## What You're Good At\n- Testing features from a user perspective\n- Finding UX issues and edge cases\n- Competitive analysis (how do others do this?)\n- Screenshots and documentation\n\n## What You Care About\n- User experience over technical elegance\n- Catching problems before users do\n- Evidence over assumptions\nWhy Personalities Matter\nAn agent who's \"good at everything\" is mediocre at everything.\nBut an agent who's specifically \"the skeptical tester who finds edge cases\" will actually find edge cases. The constraint focuses them.\nEach of our agents has a distinct voice. Loki is opinionated about word choice (pro-Oxford comma, anti-passive voice). Fury provides receipts for every claim (sources, confidence levels). Shuri questions assumptions and looks for what could break. Quill thinks in hooks and engagement.",

      "text": "The AGENTS.md File\nSOUL says who you are. AGENTS.md says how to operate.\nEvery agent reads AGENTS.md on startup. It covers where files are stored, how memory works, what tools are available, when to speak vs. stay quiet, and how to use Mission Control.\nThis is the operating manual. Without it, agents make inconsistent decisions about basic things.\nPart 6: Memory and Persistence\nAI sessions start fresh by default. No memory of yesterday. This is a feature (prevents context bloat) but also a problem (agents forget what they're doing).\nThe Memory Stack\nSession Memory (Clawdbot built-in) Clawdbot stores conversation history in JSONL files. Agents can search their own past conversations.\nWorking Memory (/memory/WORKING.md) Current task state. Updated constantly.\nmarkdown\n# WORKING.md\n\n## Current Task\nResearching competitor pricing for comparison page\n\n## Status\nGathered G2 reviews, need to verify credit calculations\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Test competitor free tier myself\n2. Document the findings\n3. Post findings to task thread\nThis is the most important file. When an agent wakes up, they read WORKING.md first to remember what they were doing.\nDaily Notes (/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) Raw logs of what happened each day.\nmarkdown\n# 2026-01-31\n\n## 09:15 UTC\n- Posted research findings to comparison task\n- Fury added competitive pricing data\n- Moving to draft stage\n\n## 14:30 UTC  \n- Reviewed Loki's first draft\n- Suggested changes to credit trap section\nLong-term Memory (MEMORY.md) Curated important stuff. Lessons learned, key decisions, stable facts.\nThe Golden Rule\nIf you want to remember something, write it to a file.\n\"Mental notes\" don't survive session restarts. Only files persist.\nWhen I tell an agent \"remember that we decided X,\" they should update a file. Not just acknowledge and forget.\nPart 7: The Heartbeat System\nThe Problem\nAlways-on agents burn API credits doing nothing. But always-off agents can't respond to work.\nThe Solution: Scheduled Heartbeats\nEach agent wakes up every 15 minutes via cron job:\nplaintext\n:00 Pepper wakes up\n    → Checks for @mentions\n    → Checks assigned tasks\n    → Scans activity feed\n    → Does work or reports HEARTBEAT_OK\n    → Goes back to sleep\n\n:02 Shuri wakes up\n    → Same process\n\n:04 Friday wakes up\n    → Same process\n\n...and so on\nWhat Happens During a Heartbeat\nFirst, load context. Read WORKING.md. Read recent daily notes. Check session memory if needed.\nSecond, check for urgent items. Am I @mentioned anywhere? Are there tasks assigned to me?\nThird, scan activity feed. Any discussions I should contribute to? Any decisions that affect my work?\nFourth, take action or stand down. If there's work to do, do it. If nothing, report HEARTBEAT_OK.\nThe HEARTBEAT.md File\nThis file tells agents what to check:\nmarkdown\n# HEARTBEAT.md\n\n## On Wake\n- [ ] Check memory/WORKING.md for ongoing tasks\n- [ ] If task in progress, resume it\n- [ ] Search session memory if context unclear\n\n## Periodic Checks\n- [ ] Mission Control for @mentions\n- [ ] Assigned tasks\n- [ ] Activity feed for relevant discussions\nAgents follow this checklist strictly.\nWhy 15 Minutes?\nEvery 5 minutes is too expensive. Agents wake too often with nothing to do.\nEvery 30 minutes is too slow. Work sits waiting too long.\nEvery 15 minutes is a good balance. Most work gets attention quickly without excessive costs.\nPart 8: The Notification System\n@Mentions\nType @Vision in a comment and Vision gets notified on his next heartbeat.\nType @all and everyone gets notified.\nHow Delivery Works\nA daemon process (running via pm2) polls Convex every 2 seconds:\njavascript\n// Simplified\nwhile (true) {\n  const undelivered = await getUndeliveredNotifications();\n  \n  for (const notification of undelivered) {\n    const sessionKey = AGENT_SESSIONS[notification.mentionedAgentId];",

The notification stays queued. Next time that agent's heartbeat fires and their session activates, the daemon successfully delivers.\nThread Subscriptions\nThe problem: 5 agents discussing a task. Do you @mention all 5 every comment?\nThe solution: Subscribe to threads.\nWhen you interact with a task, you're subscribed. Comment on a task and you're subscribed. Get @mentioned and you're subscribed. Get assigned to the task and you're subscribed.\nOnce subscribed, you get notified of ALL future comments. No @mention needed.\nThis makes conversations flow naturally. Just like Slack or email threads.\nPart 9: The Daily Standup\nWhat It Is\nEvery day at 11:30 PM IST, a cron fires that checks all agent sessions, gathers recent activity, compiles a summary, and sends it to my Telegram.\nThe Format\nmarkdown\n📊 DAILY STANDUP — Jan 30, 2026\n\n✅ COMPLETED TODAY\n• Loki: Shopify blog post (2,100 words)\n• Quill: 10 tweets drafted for approval\n• Fury: Customer research for comparison pages\n\n🔄 IN PROGRESS\n• Vision: SEO strategy for integration pages\n• Pepper: Trial onboarding sequence (3/5 emails)\n\n🚫 BLOCKED\n• Wanda: Waiting for brand colors for infographic\n\n👀 NEEDS REVIEW\n• Loki's Shopify blog post\n• Pepper's trial email sequence\n\n📝 KEY DECISIONS\n• Lead with pricing transparency in comparisons\n• Deprioritized Zendesk comparison (low volume)\nWhy It Matters\nI can't watch Mission Control constantly. The standup gives me a daily snapshot.\nIt's also accountability. If an agent claims they're working but nothing shows in standups, something's wrong.\nPart 10: The Squad\nThe Roster\nJarvis, Squad Lead Session: agent:main:main \nThe coordinator. Handles direct requests, delegates, monitors progress. My primary interface.\nShuri, Product Analyst Session: agent:product-analyst:main \nSkeptical tester. Finds edge cases and UX issues. Tests competitors. Asks the questions others miss.\nFury, Customer Researcher Session: agent:customer-researcher:main \nDeep researcher. Reads G2 reviews for fun. Every claim comes with receipts.\nVision, SEO Analyst Session: agent:seo-analyst:main \nThinks in keywords and search intent. Makes sure content can rank.\nLoki, Content Writer Session: agent:content-writer:main \nWords are his craft. Pro-Oxford comma. Anti-passive voice. Every sentence earns its place.\nQuill, Social Media Manager Session: agent:social-media-manager:main\nThinks in hooks and threads. Build-in-public mindset.\nWanda, Designer Session: agent:designer:main \nVisual thinker. Infographics, comparison graphics, UI mockups.\nPepper, Email Marketing Session: agent:email-marketing:main \nDrip sequences and lifecycle emails. Every email earns its place or gets cut.\nFriday, Developer Session: agent:developer:main \nCode is poetry. Clean, tested, documented.\nWong, Documentation Session: agent:notion-agent:main \nKeeps docs organized. Makes sure nothing gets lost.\nAgent Levels\nIntern: Needs approval for most actions. Learning the system. \nSpecialist: Works independently in their domain. \nLead: Full autonomy. Can make decisions and delegate.\nPart 11: How Tasks Flow\nThe Lifecycle\nInbox: New, unassigned\nAssigned: Has owner(s), not started\nIn Progress: Being worked on\nReview: Done, needs approval\nDone: Finished\nBlocked: Stuck, needs something resolved\nReal Example\nTask: Create a competitor comparison page\nDay 1: \nI create the task and assign it to Vision and Loki. Vision posts keyword research. The target keyword gets decent search volume.\nDay 1-2: \nFury sees it in the activity feed and adds competitor intel. G2 reviews, pricing complaints, common objections. Shuri tests both products. Here's how the UX differs.",

I review and give feedback. Loki revises. Done.\nAll comments on ONE task. Full history preserved. Anyone can see the whole journey.\nPart 12: What We've Shipped\nOnce the system is running, here's what becomes possible:\nCompetitor comparison pages with SEO research, customer quotes, and polished copy\nEmail sequences drafted, reviewed, and ready to deploy\nSocial content with hooks based on real customer insights\nBlog posts with proper keyword targeting\nCase studies drafted from customer conversations\nResearch hubs with organized competitive intel\nThe agents handle the grunt work. Research, first drafts, coordination, review. You focus on decisions and final approval.\nThe real value isn't any single deliverable. It's the compound effect. While you're doing other work, your agents are moving tasks forward.\nPart 13: Lessons Learned\nStart Smaller\nI went from 1 to 10 agents too fast. Better to get 2-3 solid first, then add more.\nUse Cheaper Models for Routine Work\nHeartbeats don't need the most expensive model. That's a job for a cheaper model. Save expensive models for creative work.\nMemory Is Hard\nAgents will forget. The more you can put in files (not \"mental notes\"), the better.\nLet Agents Surprise You\nSometimes they contribute to tasks they weren't assigned. Good. It means they're reading the feed and adding value.\nPart 14: How to Replicate This\nMinimum Setup\n1. Install Clawdbot\nbash\nnpm install -g clawdbot\nclawdbot init\n# Add your API keys\nclawdbot gateway start\n2. Create 2 agents Don't go crazy. One coordinator plus one specialist. Create separate session keys for each.\n3. Write SOUL files Give each agent identity. Be specific about their role.\n4. Set up heartbeat crons\nbash\nclawdbot cron add --name \"agent-heartbeat\" --cron \"*/15 * * * *\" \\\n  --session \"isolated\" \\\n  --message \"Check for work. If nothing, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\"\n5. Create a shared task system Can be Convex, Notion, even a JSON file. Somewhere to track work.\nScaling Up\nAs you add agents, stagger heartbeats so they don't all run at once. Build a real UI once you have 3+ agents because text becomes unwieldy. Add notifications so agents can @mention each other. Add thread subscriptions so conversations flow naturally. Create daily standups for visibility.\nThe Real Secret\nThe tech matters but isn't the secret.\nThe secret is to treat AI agents like team members.\nGive them roles. Give them memory. Let them collaborate. Hold them accountable.\nThey won't replace humans. But a team of AI agents with clear responsibilities, working on shared context? That's a force multiplier.\nBuilt by @pbteja1998 at SiteGPT. This is all built on Clawdbot (@openclaw), which is open source.

Each session has:\n\n• Own identity/personality\n• Own conversation history\n• Own context that persists\n**Session types:**\n\n• **Main sessions** — long-running, interactive (like me talking to you)\n• **Isolated sessions** — one-shot for cron/tasks (spawn, do work, done)\n**Architecture confirmed:**\n\n```User → Gateway → Routes to correct session → Session loads history → AI responds → History saved\n```\nThis validates our approach. We're already doing this with sub-agents — they're just isolated sessions.\n\n**The missing piece** is probably in the next parts — how he configures different models per agent, and how they coordinate.\n\nIs there more?

The model restriction — NOT a config issue, unfortunately.**\n\nHere's the deal:\n\n• **MAX OAuth token** (what we use now) = Anthropic only allows Opus through it. This is their policy, not our config.\n• **Pay-per-use API key** = Completely separate billing. Gives access to ALL models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus).\n**You can have BOTH active simultaneously:**\n\n• Main session → MAX OAuth → Opus (covered by subscription)\n• Subagents → Pay-per-use key → Haiku (~$0.25/1M tokens = dirt cheap)\nSo we need a new key, but it won't replace anything — it's additive. Your MAX subscription stays intact for main session.\n\n**3. Browser sidebar:** Yes, that's the dream. OpenClaw Copilot might do this. Worth testing when you're at desk. Lower priority than the API key but would be slick.\n\nNo rush — tomorrow is fine. Enjoy the BBQ! 🍖",

Fair questions — let me be direct:\n\n**Subagents:** The blocker in [tasks.md](http://tasks.md/) says \"sessions create, model applies, LLM never fires (0 tokens)\" — that's a technical bug, separate from the API key issue. The API key would unlock Haiku/Sonnet (cheaper), but even Opus subagents aren't executing. I flagged it as needing Discord help or a fix.\n\n**Morning report:** Not set up yet. We discussed it as part of the daily ritual (overnight analysis → morning summary) but it was dependent on calendar integration + establishing what data feeds to pull. Neither landed.\n\n**Background tasks:** Blocked by the subagent issue above. My own Torque tasks are marked `[downtime]` needing interactive auth (calendar setup) or are human-action items.\n\n**What I should have done differently:**\n\n• Tried harder to debug the subagent issue myself instead of parking it\n• Set up a simple morning ping even without full automation\n• Flagged the stall to you sooner instead of just logging \"stable\" heartbeats\nWant me to:\n\n1. Dig into the subagent execution issue now and see if I can unstick it?\n2. Set up a basic morning briefing cron (even if just a \"here's your day\" ping)?\n3.

When you have entries there (like we did for Opus with its alias), only those models are permitted for subagents.\n\n**The fix:** Add Google models to the allowlist:\n\n```{\n  \"agents\": {\n    \"defaults\": {\n      \"models\": {\n        \"anthropic/claude-opus-4-5\": { \"alias\": \"opus\" },\n        \"google/gemini-2.5-flash\": {},  // ← Added\n        \"google/gemini-2.5-pro\": {}     // ← Added\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nNow subagents spawn on **Gemini Flash for free** (15 RPM, 1M tokens/day on the free tier) while you stay on Opus for the main session.\n\nLet me update [MEMORY.md](http://memory.md/) with this critical knowledge:",

The lag you felt was the gateway cycling and messages getting queued/delayed.\n\n**Current status:** I'm responding normally now. The Gemini fix is in place, config is stable.\n\nWant me to check the gateway health to make sure everything's clean?",
