00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.310
Dieter Werwath: Hello?

2
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.420
Anders Boye: Hey, Dee!

3
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.200
Dieter Werwath: Hey, Andes, how are you?

4
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.090
Anders Boye: Okay.

5
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.740
Dieter Werwath: Okay.

6
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.490
Anders Boye: How are you?

7
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.750
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, not too bad, not too bad, thank you. Are you sitting at a laptop?

8
00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.189
Anders Boye: desktop.

9
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.359
Dieter Werwath: desktop, that's okay. Let me just quickly send you a link.

10
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.679
Dieter Werwath: So, Joanne told you that I was getting really frustrated that not the tools we were trying were doing what we actually wanted?

11
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.510
Anders Boye: In terms of the.

12
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.990
Dieter Werwath: Unleashed or sealed.

13
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.079
Anders Boye: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.620
Dieter Werwath: Beautiful.

15
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.469
Dieter Werwath: So… I've just built us some, basically.

16
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.410
Dieter Werwath: Let me just share this with you.

17
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.149
Dieter Werwath: Oh, do you… you don't use WhatsApp, do you?

18
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.710
Anders Boye: I don't watch, right?

19
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.640
Dieter Werwath: You don't use WhatsApp Web.

20
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.170
Anders Boye: Only sometimes I'm logged on, rarely, yeah.

21
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.489
Dieter Werwath: Okay, let me, let me send it to you by email, then that'll be easiest, I guess.

22
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.680
Dieter Werwath: You can actually open it on your phone as well.

23
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.219
Dieter Werwath: You should be able.

24
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.789
Anders Boye: Yeah, you can just send it on WhatsApp.

25
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.290
Anders Boye: Yeah, okay.

26
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.940
Dieter Werwath: So I've sent it on WhatsApp.

27
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.969
Dieter Werwath: It's not pretty, but it doesn't need to be. It's an internal tool for us only.

28
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.680
Dieter Werwath: And we can play with it later if we need to.

29
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.450
Dieter Werwath: But… This is basically a very… this is version 1.

30
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.649
Dieter Werwath: And the middle section will need to be changed. I'm just thinking that particular page on your phone probably won't look great, it's more of a desktop tool.

31
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.699
Dieter Werwath: If you just click on the menu and go to the homepage, you'll see an idea of what it's…

32
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.540
Dieter Werwath: What it's shaping up to be.

33
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.670
Dieter Werwath: My laptop is going very super, super happy.

34
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.530
Anders Boye: Where should I push, D?

35
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.910
Dieter Werwath: On the mobile…

36
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.499
Anders Boye: Yeah, I'm inside the Candid Labs now.

37
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.120
Dieter Werwath: Hey, Endless, can you hear me?

38
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.210
Anders Boye: Hey, Al?

39
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.480
Dieter Werwath: Okay, the internet's just gone down at my house, so…

40
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.120
Dieter Werwath: So, I've joined on my phone.

41
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.490
Anders Boye: Yeah, the two windows open, I'm not sure if that…

42
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.940
Dieter Werwath: category.

43
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.719
Anders Boye: One is hanging out.

44
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.610
Dieter Werwath: Because that noise will destroy me.

45
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.760
Dieter Werwath: Okay, that should be fine.

46
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.419
Dieter Werwath: Okay, can you hear me clearly now?

47
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.490
Anders Boye: Yeah, I can.

48
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.439
Dieter Werwath: This meeting is being recorded. Oh, sounds like the internet's just completely connected to my phone.

49
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.829
Dieter Werwath: Okay, let's try that again. So yeah, I'm just going to try and send you that by email, because that particular tool is definitely better

50
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.600
Dieter Werwath: Based on a desktop.

51
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.409
Dieter Werwath: Second… Which email address is best to send it to, Anders?

52
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.710
Anders Boye: Yeah, that's actually a good, question. Let me just open my laptop, because I have more email addresses in that one.

53
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.750
Anders Boye: And I just said it on the candid one.

54
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.110
Dieter Werwath: Okay.

55
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.490
Dieter Werwath: I mean, I can send it to any email address, I think I've got 3 or 4 saved for you.

56
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.150
Anders Boye: No, but that's fine, just send it in order time.

57
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.140
Anders Boye: Just fired up now.

58
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.569
Anders Boye: I saw Elle is up for dinner.

59
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.689
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so… so it seems. I mean, I didn't…

60
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.429
Dieter Werwath: Really expect either of them to join this evening when we made it optional, but…

61
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.880
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah.

62
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.709
Dieter Werwath: You know, we can, we can run through it together.

63
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.639
Anders Boye: Yeah, I am.

64
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:19.419
Dieter Werwath: After this, anyway.

65
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.220
Dieter Werwath: Just let me know when you've got that open.

66
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.150
Anders Boye: Yeah, I'm just firing it up.

67
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.440
Dieter Werwath: Give me my word.

68
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.440
Anders Boye: minutes.

69
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:15.799
Dieter Werwath: So just while we're waiting, so I've given, or I've fed this, tool, the full year 2024 from PKF and the full year 2025 from PKF.

70
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.929
Dieter Werwath: So we've got those as benchmarks to work from.

71
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.299
Dieter Werwath: What I haven't finished yet is sort of a…

72
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:34.900
Dieter Werwath: Do you remember last year when we went through this exercise, we put it into a spreadsheet, and we said, how many cases will we sell each month of each SKU?

73
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.570
Anders Boye: Yeah.

74
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.979
Dieter Werwath: So I haven't broken it down month by month yet, but that's a fairly quick fix.

75
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.370
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, okay. But when you see it, you see…

76
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.359
Dieter Werwath: We've got a couple of really quick, sort of visual

77
00:09:50.750 --> 00:10:10.599
Dieter Werwath: assumptions, and then we've got a detailed breakdown option. And essentially, all of the calculations, et cetera, it's all done for us, it's just put the numbers into the fields. So this will give us, obviously, a baseline to use, and then, essentially, what we'll be able to do is export a full breakdown in the same format that we used last year.

78
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.890
Dieter Werwath: As an Excel or Google Sheet.

79
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.490
Anders Boye: Oh, okay.

80
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.710
Dieter Werwath: Work on that.

81
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.099
Anders Boye: Okay, okay.

82
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:25.549
Anders Boye: Right, so it's a bit of a stepping stone to the Excel sheet, where it's a little bit easier to sit and… okay.

83
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:32.860
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so I've put it in three sections. I'm actually going to swap them around. The detailed one is going to be a little bit more advanced, and we'll go at the bottom.

84
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:39.119
Dieter Werwath: the top section, if you look at those, where it says Customize Scenario Assumptions.

85
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.770
Dieter Werwath: And we've got revenue growth, COGS revenue, and OPEX growth.

86
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:49.019
Dieter Werwath: And each of those 9 boxes, so the conservative, the base, and the stretch, you can actually change the numbers in there.

87
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.310
Dieter Werwath: And then that will tell you, in the table above, what it is that we're… that that means. So if we get 10% growth.

88
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.190
Dieter Werwath: In the conservative box, that means revenue next year will come out at 6.7B.

89
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.140
Anders Boye: Hmm.

90
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:17.169
Dieter Werwath: If we change that… if we change that to, say, 200%, if you want to double up, it changes to 16 points by 5 feet. So, you know, that's just a very quick visual, indicator on where we want to be from

91
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.569
Dieter Werwath: Growth percentage, our COGS, which we know we want to squeeze down, and, how we want to handle our pets.

92
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:35.870
Dieter Werwath: The middle section, we'll go through that in a second, and that's going to be the bit that we really want to focus on. But if you scroll right down to the bottom of the page, there's 3 more tools. I'll move these up a little bit.

93
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.840
Dieter Werwath: Three more quick-fire tools, right.

94
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.810
Anders Boye: to the SQU volume, or…

95
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.200
Dieter Werwath: Yes, so SKU volume.

96
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.889
Dieter Werwath: Really simple. How many cases do we think we're gonna sell next year?

97
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:59.599
Dieter Werwath: you know, it's just a… again, it's a very quick, simple tool to say, right, if we sell this many, this is what we're going to do. If we sell this many, this is what we're going to do. Green tea and Finsbury's, that's because

98
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:10.259
Dieter Werwath: I built this based on last year's, model, but I'll change that to just be SKU4 and SKU5, and obviously we'll update those if we want to use the actual names or whatever.

99
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.180
Anders Boye: Yep.

100
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.679
Dieter Werwath: If you then see, there's two more buttons where it says volume times price. If you go to Growth.

101
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:28.869
Dieter Werwath: Again, just a very quick calculator. So, how much do we want to actually grow our revenue? What is our target COGS? And, what do we think our…

102
00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:38.790
Dieter Werwath: OPEX will be And again, changing those numbers just updates the tables in that box on the right-hand side.

103
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.310
Anders Boye: Yeah, I mean, it's quite nice, it's very, like…

104
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.030
Anders Boye: Why can't anyone really, I mean, do these tools?

105
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:57.750
Dieter Werwath: I don't know, Anders, but the good news is, these are all for free. I've found ways to do it all for free. I haven't found anything, and I've looked a lot.

106
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.760
Dieter Werwath: Haven't found anything that does what we want to do. At our level.

107
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:08.090
Dieter Werwath: With a level of simplicity on the front end, but the sophistication on the back.

108
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:18.730
Dieter Werwath: You know, it's strange that nobody's built that, but anyway, we've got these tools. And then the target editor as well, it's sort of a reverse-engineered

109
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:34.170
Dieter Werwath: So, I'll make those boxes a little bit bigger, but if we want to target X in net profit and, X in OPEX with an X gross margin, what is the actual required revenue

110
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.510
Dieter Werwath: That we will have to hit for 2026.

111
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:52.240
Dieter Werwath: Because I was thinking, when we took… spoke last year, I remember we were having that conversation, let's work backwards. So, basically, these tools, those basic tools, will help us just say, right, are we being realistic here? So that's the… the high level.

112
00:13:52.770 --> 00:14:03.600
Dieter Werwath: And then the middle section, which you can see right now, is definitely a bit of a work in progress. It's a bit messy, but, what it does is it gives us our…

113
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.379
Dieter Werwath: 2024 actual.

114
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.930
Dieter Werwath: our 2025… Actual.

115
00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.490
Dieter Werwath: A year-on-year trends.

116
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.400
Dieter Werwath: And then those… if you look on the, on the…

117
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:28.970
Dieter Werwath: right-hand side, you can see that we can actually edit some of those numbers. It's not very clear. You can see the little scroll bars.

118
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:34.329
Dieter Werwath: But basically, we can actually edit what we want in those boxes.

119
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:43.389
Dieter Werwath: And then you'll see there's a little button at the top of the table saying export CSV or Copy Table, which should then paste into Excel or

120
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.010
Dieter Werwath: Google Sheets.

121
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.600
Anders Boye: Yeah.

122
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.169
Dieter Werwath: And you… yes, later, we can link it straight into the sheet, in a way, right?

123
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.989
Dieter Werwath: Sorry, say again?

124
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.889
Anders Boye: Data, we could link it straight into the sheet without exporting it, or is it…

125
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:08.610
Dieter Werwath: No, 100%. So we can actually… so what I wanted to do was expand on this, and this will be the basis of our conversation tonight, because if you remember, we went month by month. This is just…

126
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:20.700
Dieter Werwath: a year total. So this is almost, sort of, the visual output of what we want to put in. We want to put in, okay, what are we going to spend in Jan, Feb, March, all the way through to December on each of these items?

127
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.850
Dieter Werwath: We could then even break that down further if we wanted to, to say existing staff.

128
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:38.479
Dieter Werwath: incoming staff, existing SKUs, upcoming SKUs, we can add to that process. But it's just… I just feel that this is a far more,

129
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:52.559
Dieter Werwath: user-friendly setup for us to be able to do that. And when we're having the conversations, a quick update here, and we can export, or save, or link to a sheet, so that all the data is there.

130
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:55.210
Anders Boye: Yeah.

131
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.540
Dieter Werwath: Do you see it?

132
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.850
Anders Boye: Come out with a small profit in 25?

133
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:11.409
Dieter Werwath: Better than last year. If you actually scroll down, you can see this is based on actual target… on actual, data. So, we came out with… oh, wait a minute.

134
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:17.039
Dieter Werwath: That is a different number to the one that we had before.

135
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:27.400
Dieter Werwath: 445 million is… let me just… did you… have you managed to have a look at the full-year report that PKF sent to us?

136
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.390
Anders Boye: Not in details.

137
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.589
Dieter Werwath: Hold on a sec.

138
00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:46.209
Dieter Werwath: If you've got your candid email open, you'll see that from, from…

139
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.960
Dieter Werwath: PKF last week, on the 28th.

140
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.020
Anders Boye: No, let me see…

141
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:04.960
Anders Boye: my… I think the… my biggest… Sort of.

142
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.670
Anders Boye: unknown at the moment is… is listing fees and all these things with PK.

143
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.579
Dieter Werwath: You are.

144
00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.909
Anders Boye: SKD, right?

145
00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:13.919
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

146
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.409
Anders Boye: So, somehow, all these costs… We can…

147
00:17:19.629 --> 00:17:23.639
Anders Boye: this is a good tool, Dee, because if we can track them somehow.

148
00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:28.929
Anders Boye: Then we can calibrate the listing and rollouts quite nicely.

149
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:35.500
Dieter Werwath: So, essentially, Anders, I've found a way that we can build… if you can tell me what we want.

150
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.819
Dieter Werwath: We can build it.

151
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:37.350
Anders Boye: Nope.

152
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:48.920
Dieter Werwath: it's genuinely… and it might take a couple of iterations to get it doing exactly what we want, but I've spent a lot of time putting the baseline down. I've… a lot of this…

153
00:17:48.960 --> 00:18:04.129
Dieter Werwath: thousands and thousands of rows of code and logic. But now that that's done, we can then use this to do exactly whatever we want. You know, the automatic account, contract generation that's built into this system.

154
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:16.610
Dieter Werwath: I've actually dropped COGS calculators built into the system, production management and production planning, weeks of coverage for… based on actual stock.

155
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:28.989
Dieter Werwath: And all of this is based on the shitty formats that we get from SKD and from KMI, and the strange format that comes out of Xero.

156
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:44.069
Dieter Werwath: processing that into clean data. And the one thing, and I'm really sorry I can't show it yet, but I would imagine end of this week at the most, if you look at the dashboard, the website, and look at the top where it says reports.

157
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:53.120
Dieter Werwath: Let me just… So, those reports are basically all share placeholders, Bulls.

158
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:59.930
Dieter Werwath: What will be embedded there… is…

159
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.589
Anders Boye: Greg shared a Google one. Do we have an Excel sheet that we can open?

160
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.010
Dieter Werwath: It's actually in the email, in the body of the email, you can download it.

161
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.610
Anders Boye: Yeah, I'm just… I need to log into my Google, and this is so annoying, yeah.

162
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.820
Dieter Werwath: Oh, really?

163
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.990
Anders Boye: Yeah, I have to… Nope.

164
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:24.299
Dieter Werwath: I can… I can fix that for you. Oh, that's really strange.

165
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.870
Dieter Werwath: Just a sec.

166
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.279
Anders Boye: Riviani, yeah.

167
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.760
Dieter Werwath: Just one second…

168
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.220
Dieter Werwath: Let me send you an actual Excel attachment, so you can open it.

169
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.600
Dieter Werwath: Oh, my internet is so slow.

170
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.700
Dieter Werwath: I'm hotspotting my phone, and the weather's awful here.

171
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.310
Anders Boye: Hmm.

172
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:42.080
Dieter Werwath: you'll, you'll be pleased to know, maybe.

173
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.330
Dieter Werwath: that I am buying myself a Mac.

174
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:46.850
Anders Boye: Are you?

175
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.690
Anders Boye: Whoa.

176
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.179
Dieter Werwath: I actually tried to buy one today, but they didn't have any in stock.

177
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:57.519
Dieter Werwath: This machine just isn't powerful enough. It's that simple.

178
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.530
Dieter Werwath: I mean, the basic Macs are super powerful these days, I mean.

179
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.380
Anders Boye: I have…

180
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:08.960
Anders Boye: 2 Macs, but they're from 2014. I can't update them anymore, so I have really problems with them, so…

181
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.970
Anders Boye: I like to buy the highest spec and then keep it as long as I can, but after 12 years, they are giving up.

182
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:24.309
Dieter Werwath: So, I'm actually buying a Mac Mini, because I've got, obviously, at the home office, I've got everything on my desk, a Mac Mini, which…

183
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.370
Anders Boye: Phenomenal.

184
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.460
Anders Boye: power in them, I tell you.

185
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:34.759
Dieter Werwath: It's unbelievable, the raw power that's available in just… and it's 5 inches by 5 inches.

186
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:40.790
Anders Boye: No, but it's best in class, basically. At the entry level, it's best in class.

187
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:47.669
Dieter Werwath: So, they don't sell, they only… I mean, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is actually enough.

188
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.230
Dieter Werwath: They don't sell any more, they don't sell the higher one here anyway.

189
00:21:52.230 --> 00:22:00.549
Anders Boye: Oh, okay, yeah, because the way it really… where it really, you know, doesn't make sense is when you upgrade the RAM. It gets so expensive.

190
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.430
Dieter Werwath: Yeah. But that's, I mean, 16GB of RAM, with their processors, I've done a lot of research, it's more than enough.

191
00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:23.320
Dieter Werwath: And actually, I can use it and still sort of get deeply entrenched, or stay deeply entrenched in my Google ecosystem, which I'm used to for the past 10 or 12 years, but have the power and everything that comes with macOS as well.

192
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.750
Anders Boye: It is phenomenal. It is the best out there at the price, and you can easily put it in your backpack when you travel.

193
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.150
Dieter Werwath: Exactly.

194
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.259
Anders Boye: is so useful, really.

195
00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.870
Anders Boye: And it can… Run 2 or 3 monitors as well.

196
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:50.890
Dieter Werwath: Well, I've got my 34-inch monitor that I sit in front of at home, which is more than enough. I can fit 3 or 4 windows in there easily. But I've also seen, and these are really cool, you can get foldable dual monitors for travel.

197
00:22:51.800 --> 00:23:05.699
Dieter Werwath: So, it looks like a laptop, but it's actually just two screens, and you whack that onto a Mac Mini, and I can be anywhere with that. It's… yeah, it's fantastic. Yeah, like I said, I went to buy one today, and I messaged ahead just to make sure, sorry, we have no stock.

198
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:17.600
Dieter Werwath: And they're very, very, very cheap, Anders. I was surprised. I was going down the route of a high-end Chrome device.

199
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:26.639
Dieter Werwath: which are sort of the same price as entry-level MacBooks, so 22 to 25 million rupiah.

200
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.240
Anders Boye: Yeah.

201
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.760
Dieter Werwath: The Mac Mini, 9.5.

202
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.849
Anders Boye: It costs 500 bucks here.

203
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.570
Dieter Werwath: Yeah. It's, it's crazy, right?

204
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:48.769
Anders Boye: Yeah, I want to do a setup with that, maybe get a little bit better chipset, and then I want two new screens, and then I'm happy, but that's gonna be a little bit costly, right? Because I want the Mac screens, but you don't have to, so…

205
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.449
Dieter Werwath: Exactly. Unless, you know, they're all…

206
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:57.170
Anders Boye: of that, and and then you have a been for another 10 years.

207
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:15.759
Dieter Werwath: Exactly. That's the thing I'm looking at. I mean, my last… I bought the actual official Pixel Google hardware back in 2017. It lasted me nearly 8 years, and it wasn't particularly expensive, but it was phenomenal. And then it died, and I thought, you know what? I'll just get another Chromebook. They've upgraded anyway. I've had this one less than a year.

208
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:22.280
Dieter Werwath: And I've… I've killed it. It isn't enough. So, yeah.

209
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.769
Anders Boye: I'm living off my old MacBooks, and I can tell you what the… I can't even update Spotify anymore, or Google.

210
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:46.450
Anders Boye: the chipset. I mean, you know that OS is also very old now, so they stopped. But they work… it's still… you know, when I bought them, it's still 5K retina displays. They're still working phenomenally. They never… they never crashed. And I have flash drives installed, so it's a bit faster, but…

211
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.049
Anders Boye: it just doesn't work with the newer systems. So, yeah.

212
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:56.629
Dieter Werwath: That's the thing. And I think now's a good time, because the stuff that they're pumping out now.

213
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:15.979
Dieter Werwath: maybe in 10 years' time, you know, maybe it is less than 10 years that we get out of it, but it's certainly at least 5, 6 years of what's going on right now, we'll be able to run from devices we buy, or machines that we buy this year, and that's enough. For that kind of price point, five, six hundred bucks, wow, it's just…

214
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:25.070
Anders Boye: you can't… there's nothing… I mean, even the tech nerds, I was watching YouTube videos where they tested, they are so… they're so impressed with it.

215
00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.930
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

216
00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.260
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

217
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.740
Anders Boye: a tougher tough, right? And you really have to be a graphics…

218
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.379
Anders Boye: a hardcore designer for it to sweat, I think.

219
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:42.790
Dieter Werwath: That's the one thing that I said. I said, look, you know, this is what I do, this is what I need, these are the systems, platforms, tools I use, blah blah blah blah blah.

220
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.349
Anders Boye: And the only thing that they said was.

221
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:52.639
Dieter Werwath: If you use high, high-level, Video editing.

222
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.219
Dieter Werwath: Then you may run into throttles on the base level.

223
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:07.149
Dieter Werwath: Anything else you throw at it, 24-7. And that… I think that's the other thing as well, the Mac Mini, it's 24-7, so all of these systems that I'm building for Candid will just run.

224
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:15.509
Dieter Werwath: Yeah. You know, and I'll never, you know, you don't have to think about that. They're built specifically for that purpose. So, yeah, when I realized

225
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.199
Dieter Werwath: just how… I'd never even looked at the price before today.

226
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:26.100
Anders Boye: No, no, no, it's phenomenal. I almost jumped in, I just, for different reasons. I haven't bought one, but I will buy one this year.

227
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.250
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

228
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.680
Anders Boye: And eaten…

229
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.929
Anders Boye: Even if you have an old monitor somewhere, just hook it up, right, when you travel, it's phenomenal.

230
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.910
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, I just…

231
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:47.379
Dieter Werwath: And I think even… even then, I mean, so what I've looked at is, I can actually, either through Terminal, if I want to get technical, but just from remote shit share.

232
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:56.059
Dieter Werwath: I can take my shitty old laptop anywhere, open one Chrome browser, and be connected to my Mac Mini anywhere in the world.

233
00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.650
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:14.359
Dieter Werwath: It's just… I mean, the refresh rates and stuff will be down, but the power is actually being delivered by the Mac Mini, which is set on my desk, running 24-7. So yeah, once I looked at it, it just became an absolute no-brainer. So, I would have had one this… I would have had one this evening if they had any in stock this afternoon.

235
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:14.700
Anders Boye: Yeah.

236
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.520
Dieter Werwath: Anyone.

237
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:20.400
Dieter Werwath: I've sent you over the, the…

238
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:27.109
Dieter Werwath: 2025 numbers from PKF, and I've just realized what I should have sent you as well is…

239
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.689
Dieter Werwath: Have you still got the 2024 numbers?

240
00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.240
Anders Boye: I would have them somewhere, yeah. Just opening this one now.

241
00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.820
Dieter Werwath: I might as well send that as well if you've got them.

242
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.599
Anders Boye: Oh, this is a… What format is this? No, okay.

243
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.259
Dieter Werwath: That should just be in Excel.

244
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.969
Anders Boye: Yeah, it opens up, like, a…

245
00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.929
Anders Boye: Is it… is it a different format now? Okay.

246
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:59.510
Dieter Werwath: Oh, have you opened it? Has it opened directly in your Chrome?

247
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.899
Anders Boye: Yeah, that's what I… it looks like it, yeah.

248
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:16.340
Dieter Werwath: If it… that's… so when… when you… if you download it, you can open it as a normal Excel. If you open it from Gmail in Chrome, or your Chrome browser, it opens up in that shitty, sort of… it's like an online version.

249
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:16.920
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.610
Dieter Werwath: It's terrible. But if you download it, you'll see exactly as you normally do.

251
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:23.730
Anders Boye: Alright, let me download it.

252
00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.530
Anders Boye: Yeah, it's a CSV format, open width, I guess I can do.

253
00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:52.759
Dieter Werwath: That's strange, why is that confusing?

254
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.939
Anders Boye: Open with Excel, here we go. Let's see if it works. In my old Excel format.

255
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:08.460
Dieter Werwath: That could be my problem, because I've been working a lot with, with…

256
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:16.029
Dieter Werwath: code and stuff now, and I think I might have set my downloads default to…

257
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.000
Anders Boye: I'm in Excel now,

258
00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:27.049
Anders Boye: It's fine. No, we don't have consolidated… so in the 25, we don't have 24 in the same sheet?

259
00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.110
Dieter Werwath: No. God.

260
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.920
Anders Boye: No. I know.

261
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.819
Dieter Werwath: I'm just grabbing that now for you.

262
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.809
Anders Boye: Just asking, you have to include that, surely, right?

263
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.720
Dieter Werwath: Barry has been all over, Felicia this week, so far.

264
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.130
Anders Boye: How, how is… are you happy with her, or…

265
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.360
Dieter Werwath: Yes, very much so.

266
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.340
Anders Boye: Don't hear so much, so I just…

267
00:29:53.490 --> 00:30:00.569
Anders Boye: wanted to make sure she's doing what she's supposed to, and really being pushed. Do you test her once in a while, see what she can do?

268
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:09.149
Dieter Werwath: Yes, and actually, if… if… it's quite interesting, because she's, she's also… he, she, they, also…

269
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.060
Anders Boye: Yep, yep.

270
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.720
Dieter Werwath: Fairly regularly ask

271
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.829
Dieter Werwath: You know, oh, that's interesting, you know, if we have time, could you show me how to do that?

272
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.620
Anders Boye: What's to learn.

273
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:27.540
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, yeah, very much so. And isn't afraid to sort of say, well, actually.

274
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:38.839
Dieter Werwath: there's an alternative. She never has… as yet isn't confident enough to say, that's a ridiculous idea, you should do it this way, but is happy to put forward, you know, well, actually.

275
00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:45.979
Dieter Werwath: in my experience, I've done this, or I've done that, or I've used this tool. So yeah, very, very good.

276
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:59.270
Dieter Werwath: And this week is, so far, every day it's been questions to Felicia at PTF. Can you explain this? Why have you done that? So, very, very, very, very good.

277
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.519
Anders Boye: What is L sending now?

278
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.360
Anders Boye: Total.

279
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.190
Anders Boye: Hmm.

280
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.059
Dieter Werwath: What's that, sorry?

281
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.880
Anders Boye: It's just L.

282
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.880
Dieter Werwath: I'll just take a quick look in the group…

283
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.700
Anders Boye: Oh, Raya, K-T-E, great.

284
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.370
Anders Boye: They moved over.

285
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:44.200
Anders Boye: to SKD, no?

286
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.809
Anders Boye: No? Okay, right.

287
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:55.139
Anders Boye: I feel like we're slowly getting there with SKD, it's just… Obviously, taking time.

288
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.110
Anders Boye: Everything takes time.

289
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.780
Anders Boye: in… Indonesia.

290
00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.500
Dieter Werwath: I think, yeah, and I think that's where,

291
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:11.380
Dieter Werwath: we've… we've… over the past, I would say, the last… 4 weeks, or the… the…

292
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:26.360
Dieter Werwath: close to the last four weeks of December, so running up until third week of December, so last week of November and first week of December… first week of December with Barry on board. And now that she's also getting stuck into, the finances as well.

293
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.079
Dieter Werwath: A lot of that daily admin will disappear, which is nice.

294
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:37.299
Dieter Werwath: The tools that we're building, so we'll be able to literally go on and say, right, what is…

295
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.870
Dieter Werwath: It's not happening.

296
00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:47.930
Dieter Werwath: And all of that allows us to… better… Push, SKD.

297
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.269
Dieter Werwath: Because right now, I feel that we're having the same conversation over and over again, which isn't productive.

298
00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:03.049
Dieter Werwath: But it's sort of… we've got a lack of, a lack of supporting either data or whatever it is, and a lack of…

299
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.510
Dieter Werwath: Consistency in how we're managing things.

300
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:16.490
Dieter Werwath: I think Al coming on board is great, but it's still a little bit hit and miss, you know, it's sporadic when he's got time, which is fine, you know, every… we'll take every advantage we can get.

301
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:23.370
Dieter Werwath: I think, what's his name? The guy that we all spoke to? .

302
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.839
Anders Boye: Oh, yeah, Elliott, right?

303
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.090
Dieter Werwath: Yes,

304
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:40.819
Dieter Werwath: Definitely something that we… that kind of hire, whether it takes us to the middle of the year, even to the end of the year, that will absolutely skyrocket us and push us, you know, so much closer to the moon.

305
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.079
Dieter Werwath: What we need to do is bridge that gap between now and then.

306
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.720
Anders Boye: Yeah, and we just need to get our house a little bit more in order, right?

307
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.430
Dieter Werwath: Nope.

308
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:55.540
Anders Boye: get some more signatures on somebody's deal. I mean, no one expects to come into a perfect setup, but…

309
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.349
Anders Boye: I think… I have a good feeling about him. It's obviously…

310
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.100
Anders Boye: Way out of our range,

311
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.280
Anders Boye: In terms of salary right now, but…

312
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:15.759
Dieter Werwath: Well, this is the thing, and this is the big frustration. We've got no sense of consistency yet from SKD, at all.

313
00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:27.499
Dieter Werwath: Which is a shame. You know, I know it's only 6 months, and they've told us to wait, and we're not patient, but still, I was hoping it would be a little bit more consistent right now.

314
00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.460
Dieter Werwath: But if we had…

315
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:38.049
Dieter Werwath: got the level of stability that we were hoping for by now. And they were, in fact, ordering

316
00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:44.850
Dieter Werwath: 5,000 cases plus 900… so 2 times 2.6, and 1 times 900 per month.

317
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.959
Dieter Werwath: That salary would be just about in reach.

318
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:50.480
Anders Boye: Yup.

319
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.129
Dieter Werwath: With everything else we're doing.

320
00:34:52.350 --> 00:35:04.279
Dieter Werwath: And the jump that we expect to see from bringing him in, even if that means that we operate at roughly zero margin for 3 months, or 4 months.

321
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.940
Anders Boye: Okay, I feel, I mean, it's…

322
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.680
Dieter Werwath: So, absolutely.

323
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:27.500
Dieter Werwath: So, for me, that's what we need to get to. By the middle of this year, we need to have SKD, and there's no reason why that's, you know, that should be possible. That should be possible just from Bali, to be honest. I'm not talking about only Bali, I'm talking about across the board. We can get two full, large trucks and one small truck per month.

324
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.119
Dieter Werwath: out to SKD, we're already making enough to…

325
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.460
Dieter Werwath: To support that level of salary.

326
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:50.569
Dieter Werwath: So, one to Jakarta, 1 to Bali, and an extra 900 to Bali. Now, bearing in mind, that still puts Bali lower than we were with PMB. So there's no reason why we shouldn't be doing more than that. But that… that is, in my mind, that's the… sort of the threshold.

327
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:58.680
Dieter Werwath: And, you know, it's… I think that we aim for that by middle of the year.

328
00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.930
Anders Boye: Nope.

329
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:01.410
Dieter Werwath: You know, it's…

330
00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:11.660
Dieter Werwath: I know that they need time to settle in, blah blah blah, but we can't just sit back and let them have unlimited amount of time before we need to start seeing some actual

331
00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.529
Dieter Werwath: Actual movement, right?

332
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.530
Dieter Werwath: So yeah, I think that's got… still got to be there.

333
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:27.110
Dieter Werwath: Still got to be the… The goal is to get that level of person on board by…

334
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.279
Dieter Werwath: at some point during H2.

335
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:34.490
Dieter Werwath: Now, obviously, on top of that, we know that

336
00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:44.019
Dieter Werwath: Finns is solid, and sold, and in place. It's locked in. That is… there's nothing… I wouldn't say nothing.

337
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.910
Anders Boye: higher margins as well, right? So…

338
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.139
Anders Boye: Did you… did you… did you die, D?

339
00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.159
Dieter Werwath: Hey, Anders, can you still hear me?

340
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:18.899
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah, I just… I lost you, but I was just texting you, can we start again in 10? I just gotta do some… a few…

341
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.300
Dieter Werwath: Yo!

342
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.689
Anders Boye: Roll calls, is that okay?

343
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.660
Dieter Werwath: No problems at all. Speak to you in a few minutes.

344
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.639
Anders Boye: Okay, bye.

345
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:24.859
Dieter Werwath: Thanks, Anders.

346
00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.449
Anders Boye: Yeah, hi Dee, sorry I'm back.

347
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:26.220
Dieter Werwath: Hey, Mr. Beck with us?

348
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.090
Dieter Werwath: Hello?

349
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.280
Anders Boye: Yeah, Heidi, yeah, I'm back.

350
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:33.930
Dieter Werwath: Understood.

351
00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:34.830
Anders Boye: Yep.

352
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:35.630
Anders Boye: Pain.

353
00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:37.730
Anders Boye: Sorry.

354
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:46.120
Dieter Werwath: No, no, no problems, no problems. So I was just saying that, for me, a good 2026 is,

355
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.140
Dieter Werwath: Progress from 2025.

356
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:49.710
Anders Boye: Yup.

357
00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.580
Dieter Werwath: Full-time founder, plus Elliot.

358
00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.070
Dieter Werwath: To escape use.

359
00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:15.330
Dieter Werwath: I mean, that, for me, is a great year. It doesn't make millions this year. We don't want to lose money, we want to move forward, but I think that that's sort of… that would be a tick in the box, and everything else on top of that would be a bonus. And of course, we'll evaluate that as the year starts to progress, but I think, for me, that's where we're looking to be.

360
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.760
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

361
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.559
Dieter Werwath: So I guess that the… the big…

362
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:34.100
Dieter Werwath: The big question right now is, How do we… How do we… either… SKD Performance.

363
00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:43.589
Dieter Werwath: If you remember when we first came on board, they said that they were looking for 25%

364
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.699
Dieter Werwath: Coincidnier warm.

365
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:47.910
Dieter Werwath: And 10% growth in year 2.

366
00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:49.560
Anders Boye: Yeah.

367
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:57.499
Dieter Werwath: So, you… Unfortunately, For them to hit 25% in year one is looking unlikely.

368
00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:01.589
Dieter Werwath: Based on the first 6 months. Not impossible, but unlikely.

369
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.709
Dieter Werwath: So do, you know, do we still run with those numbers and expect that they're going to pick up?

370
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:07.709
Dieter Werwath: Between now and July.

371
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.630
Dieter Werwath: Or do we… Do me some of the steps.

372
00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:17.070
Dieter Werwath: Say to ourselves, okay, let's treat second half of 2025 as…

373
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:25.289
Dieter Werwath: A bedding in period of some description, and essentially start the clock now, and, you know, look at what that means for 2026.

374
00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:31.819
Dieter Werwath: And of course, you know, we can do a base, or even a conservative base of a stretch.

375
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.769
Dieter Werwath: And we know that we want to allow percentages for certain things.

376
00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:42.670
Dieter Werwath: But I think that's where we're… That's when we're…

377
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.929
Dieter Werwath: Our questions are to be able to put this together, you know, with any real clarity.

378
00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:56.080
Anders Boye: Yeah, I mean, we are… we are barely touching Jakarta, right? I mean, we got…

379
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:56.830
Dieter Werwath: Like, not good.

380
00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:03.200
Anders Boye: We are barely in the hotels in Indonesia. We are only beginning to list

381
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:09.530
Anders Boye: And we got Holywings as a big question mark. What are they moving in terms of stock, right? I mean…

382
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:12.439
Anders Boye: If we get…

383
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.430
Dieter Werwath: I mean, hold on.

384
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:14.150
Anders Boye: If we get the whole.

385
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:19.059
Dieter Werwath: gave us brief, very, very high-level numbers, and it was less than Finn's.

386
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.440
Anders Boye: Yeah.

387
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.070
Dieter Werwath: Which, I don't think that can be right, surely.

388
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:23.390
Dieter Werwath: Okay.

389
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:25.379
Anders Boye: It sounds very strange.

390
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.470
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

391
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:27.880
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

392
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:33.190
Dieter Werwath: Finns are doing anywhere between 1,000 and 1,500 cases a month.

393
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:36.139
Dieter Werwath: On average, across the year.

394
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:40.940
Dieter Werwath: And… Hollywood said that they were looking at 10,000 cases for the year.

395
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:42.639
Dieter Werwath: So it just…

396
00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:49.729
Dieter Werwath: I mean, I guess, you know, we'll see. Hopefully, we'll see soon, because there's no reason why that doesn't go live in February, as they've…

397
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:50.849
Anders Boye: Yeah. As they've said.

398
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:55.199
Anders Boye: I mean, I would budget with a thousand cases from Holywings, and then…

399
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.700
Anders Boye: Then put that in the system on top of last year.

400
00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:05.829
Anders Boye: Put some realistic movement on listings in supermarkets, mini-marks.

401
00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.920
Anders Boye: very conservatively, and then I would,

402
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.049
Anders Boye: See where we end up,

403
00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:19.060
Anders Boye: I mean, Club Med and these guys, if we get those on board, NYD, Maybe that's another thousand?

404
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.890
Anders Boye: To at least combined,

405
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:34.550
Anders Boye: And then we have some growth this year on that basis, with a steady growth in listing, and just opening up mom-and-pop stores and hotels, and…

406
00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:42.710
Anders Boye: It's really about just that consistent… we should… we should be growing,

407
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:48.850
Anders Boye: I mean, at least 50… 50-75% per year.

408
00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.040
Anders Boye: Right now.

409
00:57:51.540 --> 00:58:04.899
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, we set a minimum target for 2.5X last year, and we got nowhere near it. I mean, I know there was a lot that changed, and blah blah blah, and a huge delay, you know, we lost half a year, essentially, with everything that was going on between

410
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:09.799
Dieter Werwath: current and new distributors, but, you know, we just didn't get anywhere near, so…

411
00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:17.290
Dieter Werwath: I guess, you know, SKD, I still think we made the right decision, and long-term, that would be a phenomenal move for us.

412
00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.609
Dieter Werwath: But it's just about figuring out how we…

413
00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:26.729
Anders Boye: Yeah, we just don't know what… we're not seeing any good data, right? I mean, the good thing about SKD is…

414
00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:33.300
Anders Boye: we know we're not gonna be in for a lot of monkey business, right? P&B, they're really… Brand.

415
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:34.770
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

416
00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:47.060
Anders Boye: And that's the test now to see if we can survive that. And so far, those that have re-signed with us via SKD, that's been a huge energy booster for me.

417
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.429
Anders Boye: To see that.

418
00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:51.450
Anders Boye: And, and the fact that…

419
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:57.849
Anders Boye: I don't know how long it's gonna be, but so-so was a big misfire, right? I was a bit worried when P&B

420
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.869
Anders Boye: Got involved with them. I don't even think about Sozo anymore.

421
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:03.370
Dieter Werwath: No.

422
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:08.579
Anders Boye: And maybe I should, but I… we have bigger things to do, and, you know, even…

423
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:12.919
Anders Boye: Ms. Fish coming back to us,

424
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:19.580
Anders Boye: I think we need to really… we need… we need to really… that momentum we have now, we really need to adjust.

425
00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:22.499
Anders Boye: Do what we're doing, but doing it better.

426
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:35.490
Anders Boye: How do we put that into a budget? I would just take 25, I would add all the things that we just mentioned, and then I'll say, well, how much more do we need to… do we want to go this year, and how do we get there? That's the only way I can think of it.

427
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:49.819
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so that's exactly why I sort of tried to build those tools, so we could do it from either side, because we can put these numbers in now, and it can show us exactly where we think we'll be. So, we take 25, we add Holywings, ClubMed, LYD,

428
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:54.620
Dieter Werwath: I would say, so Hollywood's $1,000 a month.

429
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.379
Dieter Werwath: The groups, another thousand.

430
00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:02.710
Dieter Werwath: the listings, I mean… That's… that's a complete unknown.

431
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.730
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

432
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:12.679
Anders Boye: I mean, I would hope we could sell a case in every outlet, every month, of every SKU, minus Ginger,

433
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:19.260
Anders Boye: I mean, I would love to sell ginger, of course, and then have 2,000… Outlets, right? So…

434
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:28.750
Anders Boye: That would lift us a lot. I mean, the… we also need to be mindful that the real target is 30,000 cases, right?

435
01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.810
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

436
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:36.949
Anders Boye: So how do we get there? How fast can we get to that? That's a huge, huge task, right? That's excess.

437
01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:46.200
Dieter Werwath: So, if we look at 30K cases, I mean, the thing is that we can… if we can get to that 30K cases production volume.

438
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:48.559
Dieter Werwath: We can easily…

439
01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:57.589
Anders Boye: take a year to move those cases safely from our… Yes, we could do a quarterly 30,000, for instance, right? Yep, yep. Scenario, right?

440
01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:19.879
Dieter Werwath: Which means, I mean, we're excluding ginger at this point, you know, we don't see us filling 30,000, but that means that if we want to fill 30,000 cases of soda at the end of Q1, what does that take? 30,000 cases of Imperial at some point in Q2, what does that take? And hopefully.

441
01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:23.229
Dieter Werwath: Or even Q3, I mean, what have we got?

442
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.980
Anders Boye: And we need to move them relatively fast, right? So…

443
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:35.599
Anders Boye: I would think if we can start… if we can reach 10,000 cases a month, then we start looking at those production levels, right?

444
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:41.180
Dieter Werwath: So we can actually… we can sit on cases, with…

445
01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:45.339
Dieter Werwath: So far, no issues whatsoever for 12 months.

446
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:50.899
Dieter Werwath: If the numbers, if the volumes and the savings really dictate that that's the best way forward.

447
01:01:51.420 --> 01:02:03.549
Dieter Werwath: we could slowly distribute those over the space of 12 months. We don't want to sit on them for 12 months, but the reason we say that is because we've had ginger sitting for 12 months with no issues.

448
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:14.099
Dieter Werwath: And we know that SKD starts to get a little, for some reason, even though we've got a 2-year shelf life, they prefer to not have stuck with less than 12-month shelf life left.

449
01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.970
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah, we… yeah, I mean… I mean, at the end of the day, we need to…

450
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:23.079
Anders Boye: We need to take some risk on that, but not too much, because.

451
01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:23.590
Dieter Werwath: Exactly.

452
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.459
Anders Boye: By the way, fins just jumping. How many were damaged, and do we know why?

453
01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.029
Dieter Werwath: Not many, and I think it was based.

454
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:34.970
Anders Boye: You don't packaging for them, or…

455
01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.720
Dieter Werwath: Yes, yes. No, we didn't.

456
01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.820
Anders Boye: Okay, it was…

457
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.579
Dieter Werwath: It was measuring.

458
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.130
Anders Boye: off, you know.

459
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:42.650
Dieter Werwath: 100%.

460
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:45.940
Anders Boye: First one we've had with that sort of outcome.

461
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:52.340
Dieter Werwath: They've actually… that's something I'll just make a note of. They've not come back to us and…

462
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:58.130
Dieter Werwath: We've not followed up with them, to be honest. Finsed breakages.

463
01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:01.599
Anders Boye: It would just be a disaster if we have a bad batch, and…

464
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:11.110
Anders Boye: And we get stuck with something, but that's a real target. How can we do 30K production of at least the two most popular SKUs?

465
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:12.190
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

466
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.430
Anders Boye: and not sit on them for too long, right? So…

467
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:21.310
Anders Boye: I mean, if we can sell… Realistically, we need to sell

468
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:29.590
Anders Boye: 5,000 cases of soda each month for it to be a little bit more interesting, right? Or at least

469
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:36.399
Anders Boye: probably 7 and a half to 8,000 cases. Then we start getting closer to that territory.

470
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:44.760
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, but I think if we could do… if we could stabilize at 5K as our baseline for soda, knowing that we'll also then have

471
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:51.079
Dieter Werwath: Peak season, which will put an extra, looking at the numbers, 20-30% on that.

472
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:57.410
Dieter Werwath: then… Producing 30K cases is absolutely something we should do twice a year.

473
01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:02.980
Anders Boye: Yeah, so we should look at, exactly, as well say, we should look at doing that twice a year, which will give us a much better margin.

474
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:03.810
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

475
01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:07.130
Anders Boye: And, and, and we, we…

476
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:14.289
Anders Boye: you know, again, can we get it into some… one of the big chains? I mean, we'll move serious volume down.

477
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:27.770
Dieter Werwath: I think… Imperial… expecting 5K. This is the annoying thing. We know that the venues are out there.

478
01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:32.109
Dieter Werwath: And we know that SKD have those venues in their portfolio.

479
01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.090
Dieter Werwath: You know, it's that getting over that ride is this…

480
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:41.700
Dieter Werwath: is the big focus. How do we…

481
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:49.370
Anders Boye: We should really just have a call just to focus on big accounts, where they run through it, instead of having all this mismatch every time.

482
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:55.669
Anders Boye: dedicated business development calls, and not just running through the monthlies, you know what I mean?

483
01:04:56.090 --> 01:05:02.939
Dieter Werwath: But yeah, that's worthless. But those calls are just… there's almost zero value there, right? And we can frame that nicely for them, but…

484
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.909
Dieter Werwath: Essentially, that's the reason.

485
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:05.479
Anders Boye: They're cool.

486
01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.469
Dieter Werwath: training for his monthly check-ins team, you said.

487
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.020
Dieter Werwath: Focus, we are in a much better place.

488
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:15.689
Anders Boye: But I mean, with…

489
01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:27.569
Anders Boye: all these small, but fairly active, like, shady pig, and… I mean, all these things that we haven't… we never service those. That should add up,

490
01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.440
Anders Boye: to volume, I mean, some of them move 100 cases a month, I would imagine.

491
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.240
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

492
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:43.239
Dieter Werwath: You know what I mean? You get… you get… 30, 40 of those.

493
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:47.339
Dieter Werwath: plus the big ones, you're already in 5K a month, right?

494
01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.889
Anders Boye: Yeah, that's really realistic.

495
01:05:50.400 --> 01:06:00.480
Dieter Werwath: And I don't think there can be any doubt that there are not enough for us to go and get 30 accounts of that volume.

496
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.540
Dieter Werwath: you know, Indonesia is so vast.

497
01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.170
Anders Boye: No.

498
01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:13.299
Dieter Werwath: And there are so many hot spots at various parts around the country, you know, Bali's been great for us, but, you know, we've definitely got to look outside of Bali as well now.

499
01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.209
Dieter Werwath: Okay, so I think…

500
01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:26.919
Dieter Werwath: I think what we need to do is, in addition to the budget, and this will, you know, the budget will feed this, and this will feed the budget, we've got to set targets, right? And say, right.

501
01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.810
Anders Boye: So we have to have those targets, right, of the… maybe to reach the 30,000, we want to reach a certain…

502
01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:39.140
Anders Boye: Revenue, we want to reach a certain bottom line, and that's gonna take us to the next level.

503
01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.030
Dieter Werwath: Okay.

504
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:52.690
Anders Boye: Because without a good, solid bottom line, we… you know, the illage of the world, and having a bit more money to spend, and develop stuff, we've done a…

505
01:06:52.840 --> 01:07:02.759
Anders Boye: I mean, we have done quite a lot in 25. It's been a very, very strange year, right? But we have changed this position, we have gotten Ryan up and running, we have gotten…

506
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:11.890
Anders Boye: a little… little bit better understanding of, obviously, SKD, and they've had… and they're beginning to understand us. We got Ferry onboarded, we got…

507
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:20.660
Anders Boye: Some damage control, we got fins sorted, I mean, quite a lot in a year. Right now, we all got that. How do we go?

508
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:22.350
Anders Boye: Couple of X's this year.

509
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:23.690
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

510
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.380
Dieter Werwath: And I… do you know what, I think?

511
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:34.929
Dieter Werwath: even if there are higher costs involved, I think the revenue… I mean, our revenue only jumped by… I can't repeat that one now.

512
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:38.170
Dieter Werwath: yeah, most places.

513
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:44.380
Anders Boye: Big, big… You know, idle periods.

514
01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.479
Dieter Werwath: And that's what we need to avoid.

515
01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:50.210
Anders Boye: Yup.

516
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:55.370
Dieter Werwath: You know, we're not… there's no way we'll ever be… fully lineal.

517
01:07:55.830 --> 01:08:03.719
Dieter Werwath: because of the nature of, you know, seasonalities, et cetera, et cetera. But less bumpy, a lot less bumpy, is where we need to be.

518
01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.029
Dieter Werwath: And figuring out how we do that is the next step.

519
01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:15.889
Dieter Werwath: Because, as you said, with that baseline comes the ability, and not just the ability, but the comfort

520
01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:17.410
Dieter Werwath: For us to then…

521
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:23.609
Dieter Werwath: take the measures that we need to get to the next level, such as advocate and anything else that comes around it.

522
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:33.030
Anders Boye: Yeah, we got the overseas opportunities, right? But I do budget with those, you know, we, we…

523
01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.849
Anders Boye: That, that would be…

524
01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:42.870
Anders Boye: we can play with that a little bit, but just going with what we have now and increasing, I think that's the way to do the budget this year.

525
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:47.210
Dieter Werwath: So, I mean, I think that that's probably the right way, right? So we'll look at…

526
01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:57.049
Dieter Werwath: 2024 to 2025, what we did and what we… what we learned. We'll then look at 2025 plus X.

527
01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:02.120
Dieter Werwath: And that's gonna be pretty much… Across the board.

528
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:04.239
Dieter Werwath: For what we've currently got now.

529
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:13.560
Dieter Werwath: We then add in… The new opportunities that we know are close to hand, Holy Wings, groups.

530
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:19.290
Dieter Werwath: listings, we're gonna have to make some kind of estimate. Like you said, if we go with…

531
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:22.489
Dieter Werwath: 2,000 cases… 2… sorry, 2,000…

532
01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:26.139
Dieter Werwath: Outlets with one case per month per outlet.

533
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:33.030
Dieter Werwath: I think that's a fairly… let me just quickly check the… the latest numbers, which won't be through until…

534
01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:34.159
Dieter Werwath: Probably in the…

535
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.949
Anders Boye: How many places are we now currently being sold? I mean, a couple hundred, or…

536
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.219
Dieter Werwath: Over 300.

537
01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:41.939
Anders Boye: Okay.

538
01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:46.519
Dieter Werwath: Well, some of those are just… they just started in January. We don't… we don't have the data yet.

539
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.340
Anders Boye: Yeah, it's super fresh, right? So…

540
01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.459
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, yeah.

541
01:09:51.180 --> 01:10:01.139
Dieter Werwath: So, we can… so there are going to be 3 buckets that we add on. Holywings is a law unto itself, you know, that shouldn't be less than a thousand cases a month.

542
01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.379
Dieter Werwath: ClubMed, LYD, and other chains.

543
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:12.050
Dieter Werwath: Are we… are we confident to say that that should be a group total of 1,000 cases a month? I think we probably should be.

544
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.269
Anders Boye: I would, I would, yeah, yeah.

545
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:18.660
Dieter Werwath: Listings, we can go with, I mean, 2,000… we'll look at the numbers, but…

546
01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:25.020
Dieter Werwath: I don't see why 2,000 cases in modern trade across the board should be

547
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:31.070
Dieter Werwath: Anything less… anything other than the least we should expect.

548
01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.530
Anders Boye: I mean, even just for soda.

549
01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:34.930
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

550
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:36.290
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

551
01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.200
Dieter Werwath: And then we've got…

552
01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:49.320
Dieter Werwath: the new SKUs, which we need to put in place, I would say we start budgeting for them to actually be available

553
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.840
Dieter Werwath: H2.

554
01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:55.890
Dieter Werwath: Just to give us breathing room. If we get them out before July 1st, great.

555
01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:56.390
Anders Boye: Right, yeah.

556
01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:04.450
Dieter Werwath: I think, realistically, let's just, knowing that we've… all the shit that we've had with Beep Palmer Boulevard, let's just put that as a July 1st stop date.

557
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:06.190
Anders Boye: Your pole, basically.

558
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.389
Dieter Werwath: I mean, we could even sort of put one in Q3 and one in Q4.

559
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:25.140
Dieter Werwath: I don't see any reason why we shouldn't have an SKU out at some point in Q3. But if we want to be safe, a little bit conservative, and push those both to Q4, no problems.

560
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:30.709
Dieter Werwath: I guess we go with a Conservative as Q4,

561
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:40.069
Dieter Werwath: We go with the, base as 1 in Q3 and 1 in Q4, and we go with the stretch as, if we want to, as,

562
01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:44.390
Dieter Werwath: Both in NQ and H2 and Q3.

563
01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:45.860
Anders Boye: Yeah.

564
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.970
Dieter Werwath: Oh.

565
01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.409
Anders Boye: Are we just…

566
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:49.940
Dieter Werwath: I'm…

567
01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.370
Anders Boye: Let's take numbers on the new SKUs, and then…

568
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:53.450
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

569
01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:56.370
Dieter Werwath: I mean, I'd love… I would love to…

570
01:11:56.510 --> 01:12:03.850
Dieter Werwath: to massively increase our wage bill at some point during this year. Finding the step to do that is…

571
01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.139
Dieter Werwath: Keep down.

572
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:15.660
Anders Boye: You know what, I feel quite good about our two soldiers in the field, and if we can add a third one, I think we'll do really well if we could find a third one pretty soon.

573
01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:16.670
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

574
01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:22.220
Anders Boye: We can easily justify that, right? Now we know what's kind of working.

575
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:30.870
Anders Boye: They're fairly motivated. Merson, you talked about a salary increase as well, right, for him?

576
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.860
Dieter Werwath: Merzone's already had the salary increase as of December, as discussed.

577
01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.400
Anders Boye: Alright, okay.

578
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.649
Dieter Werwath: I didn't realize… I didn't realize that…

579
01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:49.349
Dieter Werwath: So, him and Jules, I spoke to Siska today. Now, when he moves and goes to Bali, he stays with Siska, and she's given me a little eye-opener.

580
01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.460
Dieter Werwath: So…

581
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:59.760
Dieter Werwath: she, you know, she's obviously still very much pro-candid. If we could pay her, I'd have her back in a heartbeat, but we just haven't got that revenue yet available.

582
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:06.010
Dieter Werwath: But she sent the… on multiple occasions, so they're staying in the same house, sitting on a walkthrough.

583
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:11.590
Dieter Werwath: Merzain gets up and goes to his meetings for, with SKD.

584
01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:20.559
Dieter Werwath: And Cisco, rather than sitting in the house in Ottawa on her own, she'll say, right, I'll drive in with you. Let's just go into the center, I'll work for a coffee shop, or whatever.

585
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:32.380
Dieter Werwath: And on multiple occasions, when they're almost in the city, or the city center, Dempassol, wherever they're going, Mirzan gets a WhatsApp, sorry, we've got to cancel, or reschedule, or whatever.

586
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:44.649
Dieter Werwath: And she said the way that it sort of started happening was, Mirzan would say, where do you want to go? And Cisco would say, you don't need to take me right to the door, you know, go and do whatever you're doing, just drop me here. And Merzanne turns around and says.

587
01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.690
Dieter Werwath: I've got nowhere to go now, because they've canceled the meeting.

588
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:51.200
Dieter Werwath: So, that literally is…

589
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.049
Anders Boye: And or an act.

590
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:57.849
Dieter Werwath: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Merzanne's very conscientious.

591
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.120
Anders Boye: Yeah, okay, okay.

592
01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.660
Dieter Werwath: I've got no concerns there. And to be honest, Cisco would tell me if she thought that…

593
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:07.779
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. No, but… but that's… oh, that's so… banana.

594
01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.340
Dieter Werwath: Right?

595
01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:11.640
Dieter Werwath: So that's literally hot off the press from earlier on this afternoon.

596
01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.030
Anders Boye: Yeah, okay.

597
01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:25.219
Dieter Werwath: So, but she also said that, and this is… I'll have to address this with both Jules and Mirzan. So, Jules and Merzan reached out directly to PKF,

598
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:29.420
Dieter Werwath: I've already spoken to, to, to Mirz and the facts, I haven't spoken to Jules.

599
01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:36.160
Dieter Werwath: directed to PKF and said, hey, just chasing up our expenses for Jan, they weren't paid with our salaries.

600
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.520
Anders Boye: And Felicia…

601
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:43.739
Dieter Werwath: said, I can't pay you because there is zero rupeeh in the accounts.

602
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:48.839
Dieter Werwath: At which point, Merzel and Jules sort of said, holy shit, is the company in trouble?

603
01:14:49.290 --> 01:15:00.060
Dieter Werwath: So, obviously that's… I mean, I'll start that out pretty easily. I'd already explained to Mirzanne what was going on, you know, that the payment was late with, with…

604
01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:03.160
Dieter Werwath: SKD, and I only… and I…

605
01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:10.580
Dieter Werwath: I would have thought that Jules would ask Alan Rate, but maybe not, I don't know. But anyway.

606
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:27.970
Dieter Werwath: long story short, I mean, that's internal communication, but I think that, again, having these… these tools and updates available will give the team a little bit more visibility on what's happening, and hopefully, you know, give them a bit more…

607
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:30.170
Dieter Werwath: A bit less anxiety.

608
01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:34.339
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, yeah. But we'll see, we'll see.

609
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:41.149
Dieter Werwath: I think you're right, if we can get one more, but I'm also getting a little bit… not…

610
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.969
Dieter Werwath: Not anxious, more annoyed.

611
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:46.300
Dieter Werwath: that…

612
01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:53.330
Dieter Werwath: these road shows to go to, you know, for SKD to invite the team out to all the places.

613
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:57.649
Dieter Werwath: There doesn't seem to be any progress there.

614
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:00.539
Dieter Werwath: Which is obviously a concern.

615
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:05.160
Dieter Werwath: Because we want to be out in those places, we want the team to go meet those people.

616
01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.490
Dieter Werwath: and I guess maybe, you know.

617
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:15.589
Dieter Werwath: We'll need to push that harder, and make sure that Jules and Mozanne are also pushing harder to get those

618
01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.430
Dieter Werwath: Those connections done.

619
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:21.900
Dieter Werwath: I don't know… yeah, there's no…

620
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:26.689
Dieter Werwath: Honestly, there's got to be a way we can… we can do that, and have that…

621
01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.569
Dieter Werwath: Moving a little bit more quickly.

622
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:33.769
Dieter Werwath: Because those 2,000 outlets that we spoke about.

623
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:43.469
Dieter Werwath: I mean, I guess that could come from just Bali and Jakarta, but I would be more comfortable if that was spread around other regions or branches a little bit further as well.

624
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:44.470
Anders Boye: Yeah.

625
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:47.130
Dieter Werwath: And obviously that then opens up whatever

626
01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:51.120
Dieter Werwath: On trade is available in those… those areas as well.

627
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.000
Anders Boye: Hmm.

628
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.730
Dieter Werwath: Morning.

629
01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:59.430
Dieter Werwath: But yeah, it's going to be interesting to see. I'll actually… I'll give the team a little nudge and say, guys, can you just nudge

630
01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:10.990
Dieter Werwath: SKD, and ask for that data. I still don't understand why we have to wait until the 15th, 20th. The data is all there, it's SAP, right? They just have to export it and send it to us.

631
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:18.420
Dieter Werwath: And the other big thing from that perspective is we're still not building that database of contacts.

632
01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:23.509
Anders Boye: But I thought that was being done by ferry already, or set up, or…

633
01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:32.160
Dieter Werwath: Oh, no, no, the database is there, it's just empty, we don't have any names or numbers to put in there, right? That's got to come from either our team or from the…

634
01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.189
Anders Boye: I thought they were working with her since last year, and that… no.

635
01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:39.109
Dieter Werwath: Note that there's almost zero movement at all.

636
01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:41.790
Anders Boye: Oh, God. Yeah.

637
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:42.700
Dieter Werwath: Yay, neither.

638
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:57.199
Dieter Werwath: So that… that for me, which is why when we… this conversation popped up again last week, and I… I love the way that Jay… you know how sometimes we realize that Jay doesn't listen to anything that goes on in our meetings? Jay came up last week and said.

639
01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.900
Dieter Werwath: Great idea, guys! Why don't we reach out to people? What's happening?

640
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.459
Dieter Werwath: Oh, my goodness, yeah.

641
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:09.379
Anders Boye: I… you know, we started this long, long time ago with,

642
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.529
Anders Boye: When, when she was resigning her, what's her name?

643
01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:15.949
Dieter Werwath: In S.

644
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:17.339
Anders Boye: Venus, right? So…

645
01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:24.320
Anders Boye: We just need to get every… all the contacts we have into the system and start building it religiously.

646
01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:24.940
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

647
01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.550
Anders Boye: Without any fail.

648
01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.850
Dieter Werwath: And that, that's just…

649
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:36.679
Dieter Werwath: you know, there's got to be… and I've actually got an option that hopefully will be something that we can do, so that can be something that will…

650
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:46.729
Dieter Werwath: be… I mean, to be honest, it's just laziness from the team. You know, there's no… there's no excuse for it. But if we can…

651
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:51.689
Dieter Werwath: Figure out a way to reduce the friction even further, then…

652
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:55.399
Dieter Werwath: You know, and hopefully that's something that's coming soon.

653
01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:57.230
Dieter Werwath: again, it's…

654
01:18:59.810 --> 01:19:06.800
Dieter Werwath: it's one of those jobs that no salespeople like to do. Salespeople are not admin people, and certainly Indonesian people, Indonesian people.

655
01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.480
Anders Boye: requirement for every visitor.

656
01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:17.879
Dieter Werwath: Yep. Yep, exactly. And that spreadsheet, that super simple spreadsheet that we set up for the first bowling trip in December.

657
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.999
Dieter Werwath: I don't know how to make that any less.

658
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.140
Anders Boye: But didn't we sign up for CRM, D, in the end, or…

659
01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.830
Dieter Werwath: No, the one page, didn't bother. To be honest, nobody was gonna use it.

660
01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.280
Dieter Werwath: Literally nobody.

661
01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:37.339
Anders Boye: But what are we doing next week? We didn't… we had a very sharp sales call yesterday, but…

662
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:41.940
Anders Boye: What is the next step, then, to get this going?

663
01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.679
Anders Boye: and get very involved, so they send it to Ferry, very…

664
01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:59.750
Dieter Werwath: I think… I think that's the… that's the… the best option. So, I've been speaking to Al. I said, Al, look, what is happening with RISMA? We've got to get rid of… RISMA's still getting paid, and she's doing nothing. So, Al's gonna fire her this week,

665
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:16.659
Dieter Werwath: we'll get ferry then into all of the groups, and I mean, they… everybody knows… it's a badly kept secret. I just didn't want to rub Risman's nose in it when Al was dragging his feet and not wanting to do it, blah, blah, blah. He got very, very upset just before Christmas, when I said, why have you not fired people yet?

666
01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:28.529
Dieter Werwath: I think he was having a bad time, and… yeah. But anyway… Yeah, it is no… it's a no-brainer. No-brainer.

667
01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:43.869
Dieter Werwath: And then, of course, the actual management or the scheduling of those outreaches. The team can reach out as and when, but we'll have regular outreaches, say, hey, just checking in, how's things going? By the way.

668
01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:50.759
Dieter Werwath: Any problems, any questions, we've got a special offer. Whatever it is, just any excuse to outreach to them.

669
01:20:50.940 --> 01:21:01.310
Dieter Werwath: So, I mean… sorry, let's get back to the budget for a second. So, we've got those… Essentially.

670
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:07.960
Dieter Werwath: 5 buckets to add, so we'll take 2025, and we'll add X percent.

671
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:16.710
Dieter Werwath: We'll then use Holywings, we'll use Groups, ClubMed LYD, We'll use listings.

672
01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:23.380
Dieter Werwath: We'll use, New SKUs.

673
01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.069
Dieter Werwath: Why is that? Oh, I guess…

674
01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.310
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, the other one is hotels.

675
01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.270
Anders Boye: I guess Point Medicine falls in between, or overlaps those two.

676
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:41.899
Dieter Werwath: But we haven't seen any kind of… yeah…

677
01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.289
Dieter Werwath: That's… that's maybe… I don't know whether we need to separate that right now, whether hotels comes within groups.

678
01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:57.720
Dieter Werwath: We can play it either way. You know, end of the day, If we've got Current Plus.

679
01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:06.000
Dieter Werwath: Holy wins at $1,000, groups at 1,000, listings at 2,000. That puts us at 6 to 7K.

680
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:07.230
Dieter Werwath: per month.

681
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.020
Dieter Werwath: And that should be the minimum we're looking for.

682
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.510
Anders Boye: Yeah, it's still not great, but, yeah.

683
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:25.509
Dieter Werwath: No. If we look at the numbers, I looked at… I pulled out the 2025 projections that we put together, and we were…

684
01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:30.820
Dieter Werwath: We're at around about 25% of where we want it to be.

685
01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.329
Dieter Werwath: So learning from that and seeing what happens, yes, we want growth.

686
01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:48.420
Dieter Werwath: But we're not looking for 4 or 5X this year, I don't think. It'd be great if we could figure out ways to surprise ourselves, but I think if we can 2X this year.

687
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:57.860
Dieter Werwath: From the original numbers, not from, you know, the shit that we had in the middle of last year, but from the original numbers, and do…

688
01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.589
Dieter Werwath: 10 to 12 billion?

689
01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:08.839
Dieter Werwath: that's probably… I mean, I'll run the actual numbers with these projections for volumes, but that's probably where we want to be, I would imagine.

690
01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:13.569
Anders Boye: Yeah, I mean, it's a realistic… it's a realistic target right now.

691
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:19.770
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, and you know, and then we can say, look, guys, if we can do this, this is how it changes.

692
01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.800
Dieter Werwath: But yeah.

693
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:29.529
Dieter Werwath: Okay, is there anything else that we need to… so… I think…

694
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:40.490
Dieter Werwath: Marketing and finance is… is locked in. We've got no concerns there, no changes required. Staffing, we want to increase that staffing, at least…

695
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:42.120
Dieter Werwath: Then 3%.

696
01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:48.350
Dieter Werwath: But I think apart from that, we should be fairly happy with that… at that level.

697
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:57.890
Dieter Werwath: If we talk about actual Senior Recruitment, Elliott level, We can sort of… Build that in as a…

698
01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:03.730
Dieter Werwath: TBC, whether it's at Q3 or Q4, but we want it by the end of the year.

699
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:04.360
Anders Boye: Nope.

700
01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.510
Dieter Werwath: What else?

701
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:16.210
Dieter Werwath: COGS is coming down because of the larger volumes, we can tweak that.

702
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:24.859
Dieter Werwath: But I think that, realistically, I think we're at… 55% at the minute.

703
01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:31.550
Anders Boye: Yeah, I think… and I'll expect a lot more of that, most of this, but we have… that's an upside.

704
01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.880
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

705
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:34.560
Dieter Werwath: Absolutely.

706
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.079
Anders Boye: Oh… I would… I don't think there's much else we can do.

707
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:45.679
Anders Boye: I'm quite sure we can reach that target if everyone pitches in and everything is sort of…

708
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:51.869
Anders Boye: Fairly smooth, and… Bintan kicks in as well, the hotel's there and everything else, and…

709
01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:00.730
Anders Boye: we get a couple of these big groups. I still think Finns will move more, I still think Holywings will move more than we estimate, but I think it's okay for a budget.

710
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:09.439
Anders Boye: Yeah. To use production, and what we can sell there is a complete question mark, right?

711
01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.439
Anders Boye: I think that could take us to a totally different level if it works out.

712
01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.450
Dieter Werwath: It really could. It really could.

713
01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:27.980
Anders Boye: And it is… it's maybe the listing fees and… and everything else in between. We have a good idea now what Sukunda charges, right? So we are not going to have any surprises there.

714
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:31.699
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so, I mean, the only thing I would say is that…

715
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:36.649
Dieter Werwath: again, and this was learnings from when Cisco was sort of managing that at the beginning.

716
01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:51.120
Dieter Werwath: one thing, we should never, ever, ever accept the first request. Ever. The listing fees that we were given, we know that SKD don't set those. They're set by the actual

717
01:25:51.720 --> 01:26:01.910
Dieter Werwath: the branches, etc. So, I think one initiative for us is to push to be more involved in those conversations directly with the chains.

718
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:06.459
Dieter Werwath: There's been no indication at all

719
01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.480
Dieter Werwath: that SKD are trying to make any kind of margin on the listing fees from any of the chains that we've

720
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:17.000
Dieter Werwath: That we've, currently onboarded with.

721
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:21.830
Dieter Werwath: Which suggests that there shouldn't be any

722
01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:26.410
Dieter Werwath: Issues without a team being involved in those conversations.

723
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:38.420
Dieter Werwath: So, my thoughts would be, again, partly to grow our database of contacts, and partly to have visibility and be able to move more quickly, is to have the team

724
01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:46.620
Dieter Werwath: join those conversations more… more and more often, and push for more of those conversations to be happening. We asked for a list of all of the… the…

725
01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.260
Dieter Werwath: Potential chains that we could onboard.

726
01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.619
Dieter Werwath: We got, I don't know, 10 or something? 10 or 11?

727
01:26:52.860 --> 01:27:01.419
Dieter Werwath: And we've done three, and maybe a fourth. We've gone for the slightly larger ones, and the strategic bombs, that makes sense, but…

728
01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:02.930
Dieter Werwath: there's no…

729
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:10.339
Dieter Werwath: there's no urgency from SKD's side to go and complete that list and get the rest onboarded. So from that side, you know.

730
01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:18.200
Dieter Werwath: And also, on that note, you know, we've had… we've been through the designs and the vendors, or not vendors.

731
01:27:19.210 --> 01:27:26.990
Dieter Werwath: 2026 should be much, much more smooth for onboarding new modern trade. No questions there.

732
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.360
Anders Boye: Yup.

733
01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.170
Dieter Werwath: I'm going…

734
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:34.860
Anders Boye: we… we probably need to increase the marketing spend a bit for social media and TikTok and… and…

735
01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:42.000
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so Ryan is hammering us for a budget. That's something that does need to come out of this. What can we actually spend on.

736
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.239
Anders Boye: Yeah. Not just his… his actual…

737
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:54.790
Dieter Werwath: fees. So, yeah, he's… Ryan's fine, but he's saying, guys, you know, we're behind now where we should be.

738
01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:59.240
Anders Boye: Yeah. And you're the only, you know, we're the ones that are going to actually suffer.

739
01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:07.699
Dieter Werwath: He said, you'll keep paying me, and I'll keep doing everything I can, but you… you knew the plan right from the beginning. I was very open. I said, yep, yep, I know, I know,

740
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:16.339
Dieter Werwath: And, you know, that's fine. So, I would say, originally, I can't remember the percentage, but we've got it somewhere in the 2025 projections.

741
01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:19.850
Dieter Werwath: Originally, we had What's it like?

742
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:22.099
Dieter Werwath: 900 million for the year.

743
01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:27.650
Dieter Werwath: And essentially, that covers…

744
01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:35.290
Dieter Werwath: the basics. So now we've got to say, right, what do we want to spend, or what can we spend, what should we spend? On top of that.

745
01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:38.150
Dieter Werwath: To supercharge this, to, you know, to actually put.

746
01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:44.109
Anders Boye: paid marketing out there to run campaigns. And we need to test a few things we haven't tried before, and learn from it.

747
01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:44.890
Dieter Werwath: Absolutely.

748
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.270
Dieter Werwath: Absolutely.

749
01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:58.789
Dieter Werwath: You know, he's got a whole playbook of things that we can do, and, you know, some things that he will recommend against, and we might want to try it anyway, just because we can. You know, that's… there's no right or wrong for that small level.

750
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:02.209
Anders Boye: levity hands and play with that a bit. We need to create.

751
01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:02.600
Dieter Werwath: I guess.

752
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.410
Anders Boye: Noise, but not a big campaign or anything, just a bit of noise.

753
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:07.370
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

754
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:16.400
Dieter Werwath: And there's nothing stopping us from doing that, right? So, I think from that perspective, We need to…

755
01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:18.379
Dieter Werwath: Essentially, pick a number.

756
01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:23.230
Dieter Werwath: Present it to him, and if he laughs in our faces and says, guys, you know.

757
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:32.409
Dieter Werwath: 500 bucks a month isn't enough. What are you smoking? That's fine. Give us an idea. In fact, that's actually what I'll do. I'll say to him, look, realistically, give me three scenarios.

758
01:29:32.770 --> 01:29:35.549
Anders Boye: Yeah, yeah, give us some ideas, yeah, so…

759
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.100
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

760
01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:42.040
Anders Boye: Yeah.

761
01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:50.759
Dieter Werwath: And then, I mean, that's it, really. We've got a little bit of expense coming from BPAC.

762
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.890
Anders Boye: Every year, a year.

763
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:58.190
Anders Boye: big… Apart from the new SKUs this year, we don't have big

764
01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:02.080
Anders Boye: Change is coming. We are fairly stable now.

765
01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:09.110
Anders Boye: we just have housekeeping, opening accounts.

766
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.790
Anders Boye: I'm just getting more out of SKD,

767
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:17.649
Anders Boye: it's… it's a… last year was exhausting just to think about, right? We got holes…

768
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:23.990
Anders Boye: It should really be a year where we are making some smooth sailing.

769
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:28.509
Anders Boye: Optimizing what we can optimize, and getting ready for

770
01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.390
Anders Boye: Professionalization and the funding round, really.

771
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:45.900
Dieter Werwath: And I think that that's… that's really, yeah, for me, that's got to be the focus, because the quicker we can get that done without rushing, but the quicker we can get that done and get cleaned up with Marek and everything else.

772
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:46.360
Anders Boye: Yeah.

773
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.529
Dieter Werwath: I mean, that's just…

774
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:54.060
Dieter Werwath: you know, that on top of everything else has been a ballache. Removing that from our

775
01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:58.590
Dieter Werwath: Radar will be such a huge step forward.

776
01:30:59.060 --> 01:30:59.600
Anders Boye: Yup.

777
01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:03.099
Anders Boye: What are we doing with the FOC for P&B?

778
01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:08.519
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so I'm gonna have to speak to them again. You know, we've just been sort of keeping them at arm length,

779
01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:14.740
Dieter Werwath: I've got a horrible feeling that when… if we… if we offer them, you know, to pay them out,

780
01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.300
Dieter Werwath: They're gonna say.

781
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:23.279
Dieter Werwath: they're going to try and say, well, look, we make X from that, so that's what you've got to pay us. And that's not the case.

782
01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:28.179
Dieter Werwath: what I would love to do is only pay them as much as they would have paid

783
01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.080
Dieter Werwath: SKD.

784
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:43.510
Anders Boye: I want a discount on the dollar, actually, just to close the case, and frustrate it a bit, because I don't… I just fucking hate those guys, but I know that's unrealistic, maybe.

785
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:52.390
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, so, I mean, if we look at what they were supposed to be selling at, which is 75 and 95, I'm not paying that. I'm not paying cash.

786
01:31:52.620 --> 01:32:00.230
Dieter Werwath: If you look at what they were buying at, which was… 4, 8, and 6-8, that's…

787
01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:00.990
Anders Boye: Yeah.

788
01:32:00.990 --> 01:32:02.699
Dieter Werwath: More like it.

789
01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.819
Anders Boye: And it's very simple, they talk so, so, so, I'm sorry.

790
01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.130
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

791
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.890
Anders Boye: What, what… so then we need to maybe shut up.

792
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:17.990
Anders Boye: We sit with the royal account for KF.

793
01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.630
Dieter Werwath: Sorry, Honda, say it again.

794
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:26.030
Anders Boye: KKS situation, has that been rolled out?

795
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:27.860
Anders Boye: Millionaires?

796
01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.180
Dieter Werwath: You need to get that moving as well, right?

797
01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:37.100
Dieter Werwath: Because that's 350 or 330 or whatever, it sat there doing nothing. Okay, yes.

798
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:38.779
Dieter Werwath: Full it with Teddy.

799
01:32:43.170 --> 01:32:43.840
Anders Boye: I don't…

800
01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.540
Dieter Werwath: One more…

801
01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.400
Anders Boye: Growing it up.

802
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:57.579
Dieter Werwath: I think it was.

803
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:06.570
Anders Boye: And of course, it would be great to get aviation done in the targets as well, right? That would be a steady flow.

804
01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:12.040
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, that would be a big one, and I think it may be a issue.

805
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:21.330
Dieter Werwath: And didn't… I'm sure that SKD said they had an inroad there as well, right?

806
01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:24.360
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, yeah.

807
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:29.810
Anders Boye: And again, Ismaia, no one really can answer what we do with Ismaia.

808
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:42.219
Anders Boye: But that needs to be… yes, we really should get going, just file it, let it run its course.

809
01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:44.430
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

810
01:33:49.410 --> 01:33:59.039
Dieter Werwath: We will have a little bit less. We had some pretty big bills, sort of legal slash consultant bills last year that we've… won't have this year.

811
01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:02.390
Dieter Werwath: Which will help out there.

812
01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.679
Dieter Werwath: In that particular area.

813
01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.600
Dieter Werwath: I think you're right, there's not a lot…

814
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:13.130
Dieter Werwath: of change to… that sounds deaf. There's a lot of change to make this year, but…

815
01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.060
Dieter Werwath: Not those kinds of changes.

816
01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.079
Anders Boye: Not super big infrastructure, and… and…

817
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:18.649
Dieter Werwath: in the office.

818
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:25.190
Dieter Werwath: Okay.

819
01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:31.559
Anders Boye: But from PKF, I saw, she sent something to you the other day. Cheryl, what's her name?

820
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:33.970
Anders Boye: PKF Singapore.

821
01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:36.400
Dieter Werwath: Oh!

822
01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:42.080
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, what was, What was it she asked for?

823
01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.170
Dieter Werwath: Bank statements.

824
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:59.760
Dieter Werwath: Someone who goes from you.

825
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.999
Dieter Werwath: And then the invoices of order reasoning, what the f-

826
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.509
Dieter Werwath: I've got no idea where they will be. I'll have to dig them out.

827
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:11.940
Dieter Werwath: March?

828
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:17.190
Dieter Werwath: Wait, March 24 to March 24? What's that?

829
01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.489
Dieter Werwath: I'll clarify what she actually needs from there.

830
01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:36.690
Anders Boye: We should probably have a quick meeting with them next week, just to get going on this year, right?

831
01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:42.590
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, not quite sure what…

832
01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:52.470
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, I remember reading it now. There's a couple of things in there that don't really make a lot of sense, but…

833
01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:56.910
Anders Boye: at some point in time, we need to top up Singapore, but we have 10K still here, but…

834
01:35:57.470 --> 01:36:02.329
Anders Boye: I'm quite sure with annual reporting and everything else, we need to…

835
01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:06.370
Dieter Werwath: We can… so, I guess…

836
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:14.920
Dieter Werwath: We can… repay the load.

837
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:22.850
Dieter Werwath: Indonesia over Singapore, 12, 15,000 US?

838
01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.029
Anders Boye: Yeah, okay.

839
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:31.700
Dieter Werwath: So we can certainly send that across ASAP, or towards that. So, we've got reason to move money, put it that way.

840
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:34.700
Dieter Werwath: So yeah, well, that's… let me make a note repo, though.

841
01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:44.769
Dieter Werwath: Actually, that was… When I was talking to Ferry, and we were going through the finances and stuff, and I said, you need to do this, this, this, this,

842
01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:58.909
Dieter Werwath: And she said, what about this 15, 14K, whatever it is? So that's on hold. I explained roughly the situation, but, yeah, that's why it's fresh in my mind. But that's fine. So we can move some money.

843
01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:00.450
Dieter Werwath: ASAP.

844
01:37:01.050 --> 01:37:06.750
Dieter Werwath: Al wants to take a payment this week, if possible, when SKD pay.

845
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:08.590
Dieter Werwath: Should be no problems at all.

846
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:12.559
Dieter Werwath: And, you know, in line with what we've already agreed.

847
01:37:12.690 --> 01:37:14.230
Dieter Werwath: But I just said to him, look.

848
01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:17.500
Dieter Werwath: because we've had low orders in Jam.

849
01:37:17.670 --> 01:37:21.099
Dieter Werwath: I might not send you 100, might I send you 50? He's like, yep, no problems.

850
01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:25.380
Dieter Werwath: But that's… I've got no concerns there at all.

851
01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:26.210
Anders Boye: how to go.

852
01:37:26.210 --> 01:37:28.129
Dieter Werwath: Ryan has just replied.

853
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:34.480
Dieter Werwath: Okay.

854
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:38.590
Dieter Werwath: So, basically.

855
01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:47.190
Dieter Werwath: last year was 50K, 48K or 49K, something like that. And he said, I'd go $60K, although we would not spread evenly.

856
01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:54.289
Dieter Werwath: We need to ramp up ASAP, and then maintenance campaign for Ramadan, which is coming soon.

857
01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.910
Anders Boye: Yeah, okay.

858
01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:01.780
Dieter Werwath: So, that's actually… That's probably less than I was expecting to ask for, to be honest.

859
01:38:04.150 --> 01:38:10.999
Dieter Werwath: There's gonna be… but there's gonna be slightly more than that. I don't think he's remembered that we agreed to…

860
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:13.690
Dieter Werwath: 2… quarterly.

861
01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.159
Dieter Werwath: press releases.

862
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:26.530
Dieter Werwath: Which cost around about 2.3, I think, each. I'll just double check. But that's actually… that's better than I expected. I thought… I guess I shouldn't have it, you know…

863
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:34.629
Dieter Werwath: I maybe thought of him as a standard agency for a second. They just always want more, more, more, more. Okay, that's fine.

864
01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.770
Dieter Werwath: So… That's cool.

865
01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:47.440
Dieter Werwath: store, and you can see… I'll take a quick look at what we've spent on…

866
01:38:47.710 --> 01:38:53.459
Dieter Werwath: Things like, activations, samplers in the modern trade.

867
01:38:53.890 --> 01:38:56.410
Dieter Werwath: It's hard, it's hard to judge.

868
01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.880
Dieter Werwath: The performance or the impact, because we don't have the bloody sales data.

869
01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:02.630
Anders Boye: you know.

870
01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.560
Dieter Werwath: In and around those times.

871
01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:09.199
Dieter Werwath: Okay, that's something that I'll speak to Fanny about.

872
01:39:10.130 --> 01:39:16.689
Dieter Werwath: Because it's hard to show that that actually works unless we can see the impact, right?

873
01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:17.680
Anders Boye: No.

874
01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.270
Anders Boye: Yeah, exactly.

875
01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:20.830
Anders Boye: Mindy.

876
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:29.129
Dieter Werwath: Still actually why we can't get more

877
01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:35.129
Dieter Werwath: visibility on… on sales data. It just doesn't make any sense to me.

878
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:44.680
Dieter Werwath: We'll get… Jules and Merzon have been reasonably successful in getting branch-level data.

879
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:52.929
Dieter Werwath: outside the normal channels for December and Jan, so we'll try and get… sorry, November and December. So we'll try and get that for Jan as well.

880
01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:03.940
Dieter Werwath: Okay, is there anything else that we are missing from… let me just open up the, 2025.

881
01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:12.379
Anders Boye: No, I don't think so, Dee, to be honest. I mean, there's a lot of upside in that budget, certainly also a little bit of downside, but not a lot, and I think…

882
01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:17.290
Anders Boye: I would be… I would really hope…

883
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:23.360
Anders Boye: Doble it this year from what we are putting in, but, you know, that's for the…

884
01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:34.529
Anders Boye: If we can keep signing new accounts, we should be. Because it's very, very… it's a very conservative budget on stuff we think we have almost, right, in hand.

885
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:36.389
Dieter Werwath: Exactly, exactly.

886
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:39.539
Anders Boye: So we're aiming at doubling that,

887
01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:44.000
Anders Boye: And just really go for it, and do what we do best at the moment.

888
01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:44.940
Anders Boye: Yep.

889
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:52.199
Anders Boye: So I think I'll keep it to that, and then let the boys give their input on it when we go through it with them later.

890
01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:53.900
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

891
01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:58.200
Dieter Werwath: Just looking at last year's document.

892
01:40:59.350 --> 01:41:03.930
Dieter Werwath: I mean, we put zero revenue for them, but we just obviously felt that it was…

893
01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:07.109
Dieter Werwath: Important enough to make a note.

894
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:08.260
Dieter Werwath: Coffee?

895
01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:12.879
Dieter Werwath: Coconut water, still water, and try.

896
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:17.280
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, I mean, water I still believe in, but… Yep.

897
01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.239
Anders Boye: I think… I think we should really focus on some…

898
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:24.770
Anders Boye: ITDs that will put us on the map.

899
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.750
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

900
01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:30.210
Dieter Werwath: And I'm inspired by, I mean.

901
01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:36.269
Anders Boye: You know, we should do a healthier version of an energy drink at one point in time, I think, as well.

902
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:37.440
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

903
01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:44.059
Anders Boye: You know, a… maybe that could be, like, prime based on coconut water with something else for something else.

904
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:47.990
Anders Boye: But, yeah, because the market is enormous.

905
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:52.759
Dieter Werwath: You've only got to take a small, a tiny little slice, right?

906
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:53.590
Anders Boye: Hmm.

907
01:41:54.530 --> 01:42:00.300
Dieter Werwath: Okay, so that's actually something else that, that is, is almost built,

908
01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:10.090
Dieter Werwath: I think the data that we've now got, and the structure that we've now got, and, you know, you've seen a very, very small taste there with the website that's…

909
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:12.690
Dieter Werwath: That's in place now.

910
01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:16.090
Dieter Werwath: But… I just… even with Jay…

911
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:18.789
Dieter Werwath: On board, and, and sort of…

912
01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:23.220
Dieter Werwath: I wouldn't say he's managing the R&D, particularly.

913
01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:29.080
Dieter Werwath: It's good that he feels involved, but I think that we can do that better.

914
01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:45.269
Dieter Werwath: And I think that we need to have this list of targets that is converted to a confirmed library of potential SKUs that we can then pick and choose from and assess at various times during our journey.

915
01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:48.829
Dieter Werwath: You know, and I think that, again, that's something that…

916
01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:57.819
Dieter Werwath: Shouldn't be any later in Q1, we should have that… and a structure that we can say, okay, guys, what about this?

917
01:42:58.050 --> 01:43:07.860
Dieter Werwath: And we know that to take just a crazy, top-of-the-head idea to step one in the journey is just to assess feasibility.

918
01:43:08.190 --> 01:43:15.449
Dieter Werwath: If we then feel it's feasible, we go and we start building potential recipes. Once we get to that stage, we start looking at cost.

919
01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.190
Dieter Werwath: Once we get to that, you know, I think that that's…

920
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:26.630
Dieter Werwath: I'm sure… I guess that Jay, being more in the… on the vendor side, you know, he's the one that goes out there and

921
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:29.999
Dieter Werwath: And sells those components, rather than

922
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:44.449
Dieter Werwath: plans them and brings them together. So maybe that's the gap, but I think that that's something that we can systemize and semi-automate and build that library, start to build that library, without losing focus on the two that we've got in the pipeline right now.

923
01:43:45.850 --> 01:43:49.260
Anders Boye: Another thing I would be very keen to put as a…

924
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:58.199
Anders Boye: As a note for the budget is alternative income streams that can be actually with the network, with our expertise now.

925
01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:06.179
Anders Boye: import certain SKUs and… and… and create… I mean, these are high…

926
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:14.390
Anders Boye: margin things that we could… we can… we can explore and develop. Candid Unisoda, a bit…

927
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.930
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

928
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:19.070
Anders Boye: There are some massive opportunities there,

929
01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:25.769
Anders Boye: Funnily enough, one of the guys I… I was in Jakarta with two weeks ago.

930
01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:29.639
Anders Boye: He just took Singha franchise for Taiwan.

931
01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:33.380
Dieter Werwath: Singer in Taiwan.

932
01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:38.999
Anders Boye: Bingha sold a wall in Taiwan, yeah? So I said, I need those numbers when you have them.

933
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.549
Dieter Werwath: Yes, absolutely.

934
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.990
Anders Boye: So…

935
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:41.860
Dieter Werwath: Absolutely.

936
01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:46.090
Anders Boye: It's a very… for him, it makes sense, because he has a big…

937
01:44:46.730 --> 01:44:50.590
Anders Boye: You know, it's just adding it into the chops of everything else he's doing.

938
01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:51.310
Dieter Werwath: Ian.

939
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:52.629
Anders Boye: syrups, right? So…

940
01:44:52.930 --> 01:45:04.080
Anders Boye: But the thing is, with our network, and I'm selling a shitload of monster drinks in Singapore now, and Prime still, even though it's low margin Prime now, but…

941
01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:08.909
Anders Boye: I'm so baffled of how much you can sell, online.

942
01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:09.570
Dieter Werwath: God.

943
01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:17.240
Anders Boye: And I'm just thinking, if we choose a few SKUs, whatever we do, Unisolder can be anything, right? Of course, we will.

944
01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:17.820
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

945
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:22.940
Anders Boye: on call, but let's try and develop a Trade as Joe mentality, maybe?

946
01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.449
Anders Boye: And, and see if we can do something completely different.

947
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:37.420
Anders Boye: And give that as a competition for all of us when we get together and say, what other… you know, it could be vending machines with our own SKUs and mainstream SKUs.

948
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:38.250
Dieter Werwath: I'm single.

949
01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:44.209
Anders Boye: control, because the margins I don't know what we can sell a drink for in a vending machine, but…

950
01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:48.629
Anders Boye: It would be double margins of what we sell it to for SKD.

951
01:45:48.630 --> 01:45:49.960
Dieter Werwath: table. Yep.

952
01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.249
Anders Boye: And if we can piggyback with a big vending machine operator who has

953
01:45:54.740 --> 01:46:01.390
Anders Boye: You know, it's not unrealistically 5,000 vending machines, you can actually move some serious volume.

954
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.130
Dieter Werwath: That's definitely…

955
01:46:06.130 --> 01:46:18.139
Anders Boye: The revenue, it will be enormous revenue, and the margins are insane, and that will fuel us into other things, and that… we need to… we need to find a few cash cows, because

956
01:46:18.450 --> 01:46:23.309
Anders Boye: We could probably even convince SKD to sell it on our behalf as a SOP.

957
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:26.340
Anders Boye: I mean, if we bring it in and they distribute it.

958
01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:42.890
Anders Boye: that's the channel, we can distribute it only for Jakarta, we can… we can send it on another truck to Bali and have a SOPD doing it separately. We know how to do this now, and we can invoice a lot more, and I think it's a lost opportunity not to look at that.

959
01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:51.850
Anders Boye: So, what I would say is, I would, in the new hire, I would also look at business development, a guy who's just doing business development.

960
01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.110
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

961
01:46:54.010 --> 01:46:58.550
Dieter Werwath: Not… not sales, but actually growing the group.

962
01:46:58.550 --> 01:47:01.370
Anders Boye: Growing revenue streams, right?

963
01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.700
Anders Boye: for the business.

964
01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:06.470
Dieter Werwath: Just hold that… just hold that for one minute, please, Alice.

965
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:47.530
Dieter Werwath: Thank you, Anders.

966
01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:54.150
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, no worries. I'm sorry to say that. Yeah, I think that that's something, you know, we've discussed several times, and I think that.

967
01:47:55.090 --> 01:47:55.650
Anders Boye: Yep.

968
01:47:55.650 --> 01:48:00.199
Dieter Werwath: Having that, somebody who's got that as a key focus, as a core driver.

969
01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:00.930
Anders Boye: Yep.

970
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:14.949
Anders Boye: Yeah, and I… you know, I would… you know, we could do just the machine with ginger and see how that goes. That would be a PR stunt in itself, right? We could do, just with sodas, we can do small ones on counters.

971
01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:20.840
Anders Boye: those are more PR-related, but having some serious volume we can move in with containers.

972
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:28.860
Anders Boye: I… I think… I think that would be… it can… we can really, really go high in revenue quickly.

973
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:34.909
Anders Boye: And if it's managed… fairly nicely, we can do B2B, right?

974
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:36.440
Anders Boye: And…

975
01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:36.890
Dieter Werwath: S…

976
01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:39.740
Anders Boye: Piped the ticket down, so,

977
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:53.609
Anders Boye: It could be a product that's not in Indonesia, we can try and get the, licensing for it, for Indonesia, that would be my preferred option, long-term licensing. We have the pedigree and the…

978
01:48:54.060 --> 01:49:02.169
Anders Boye: we have something to show for now, Unisoda, right? I mean, and our collaboration, so why can't we move other people's products?

979
01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.140
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

980
01:49:03.490 --> 01:49:08.619
Dieter Werwath: And I think that's that leveraging that visibility now.

981
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:12.899
Anders Boye: Obviously, it's not like a compliment to what we're doing, because that makes sense, but…

982
01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:20.989
Anders Boye: Vending machines are gonna be a big thing. It's a huge thing in Thailand now. It's huge in Singapore, little Singapore.

983
01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:30.500
Anders Boye: Because of manpower issues. I'm putting up one next week with exotic candies, and we're expecting to sell up to $10,000 a month on one vending machine.

984
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:32.560
Anders Boye: So…

985
01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.260
Dieter Werwath: Credit.

986
01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:41.149
Anders Boye: But even if 5, it'll be successful, and that can fund the next, one, and then the next 2 can fund the next 6, right?

987
01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:47.259
Dieter Werwath: So I've just sent you a link on WhatsApp from the guys that I was working with. Yeah, the, the…

988
01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:55.800
Dieter Werwath: the financial company, and they were… I mean, COVID obviously put a stop to that, but they were flying. They were absolutely flying.

989
01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:56.380
Anders Boye: Yep.

990
01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:00.050
Dieter Werwath: And I see more and more vending machines here, and those smart vending machines, and you know what?

991
01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:04.520
Dieter Werwath: So how many things where people can just tap, or scan, or QR, whatever it is.

992
01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.299
Dieter Werwath: It's so handy. It's so…

993
01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:14.700
Dieter Werwath: You know, any way that you can get people to spend money without handing over physical cash, so much easier for people to spend, right?

994
01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:20.170
Anders Boye: Yeah, I mean, there's a maintenance, there's a stocking and all that, but in Indonesia, it's not that tricky, right?

995
01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:26.550
Anders Boye: And a lot of these smart vending machines have a little, stash area as well.

996
01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:31.659
Anders Boye: where you can keep in behind a fair amount of SKUs,

997
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:38.159
Anders Boye: So I think it's just a… it's just brainstorming, because I think we can do so much more than just be a producer.

998
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:44.370
Anders Boye: Which will enable us to buy and develop other things for our core brand.

999
01:50:46.080 --> 01:51:00.629
Anders Boye: I mean, think about CIA, who used cocaine to fund the wars against the, I mean, I'm not… I'm just saying a lot of companies do this, right, to… to… they develop other businesses because they identify synergies, and that shouldn't stop us.

1000
01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:13.349
Anders Boye: We have very low margin business, we need very high volume, we don't have our own line, thank God, for that at the moment. But if we can start… anything we can go in now, we'll go almost straight to the bottom line.

1001
01:51:14.230 --> 01:51:19.680
Dieter Werwath: And I think as well, you know, you say that about the synergies, we've… weird…

1002
01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:23.040
Dieter Werwath: I would say basically wide open.

1003
01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:25.710
Dieter Werwath: Because those synergies

1004
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:33.339
Dieter Werwath: now don't necessarily need to mean synergies for a mixer. They don't even need to mean synergies for a beverage.

1005
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:33.770
Anders Boye: Normally.

1006
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:39.140
Dieter Werwath: Synergies for the channels and the markets, as well as the products.

1007
01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:39.680
Anders Boye: A wide one?

1008
01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:40.140
Dieter Werwath: Wow.

1009
01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:42.989
Anders Boye: One-stop shops for bars, a whole kit

1010
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.810
Anders Boye: Sell, sell, right? Unisol? Yeah. Yeah.

1011
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:58.960
Dieter Werwath: You know, and, you know, it doesn't have to be directly associated with the Candid brand in any way, shape, or form. It is purely a corporate level.

1012
01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:02.560
Dieter Werwath: Decision on a corporate level.

1013
01:52:02.670 --> 01:52:06.199
Dieter Werwath: Promotion and distribution, and we can, you know, we can look at it that way.

1014
01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:14.939
Anders Boye: Yeah, we're just a separate entity, but it's obviously in the same P&L, and then we can rebrand… we can brandish something, and then we have a sales rep for that.

1015
01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:21.409
Dieter Werwath: Well, I mean, it doesn't even need to necessarily be a separate entity, it could be a separate department within the university.

1016
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:23.829
Anders Boye: Separate, .

1017
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:26.700
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, I mean, keep them… keep them separate, mentally.

1018
01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:27.240
Anders Boye: Excellent.

1019
01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.900
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, totally agree.

1020
01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:37.209
Anders Boye: So I think that's just an op… we need to look at opportunities. What is… what is there? What can we do? Where are the fat margins? Where are the… where's the move… move?

1021
01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:39.719
Anders Boye: Movement to be.

1022
01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:45.839
Dieter Werwath: you know, tapped into, and it can be an online-only proposal in the beginning, just for Greater Jakarta.

1023
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.399
Anders Boye: To dip, to dip.

1024
01:52:47.970 --> 01:53:05.630
Anders Boye: dip our toes into, and… and I think that could generate phenomenal results, and with very little effort, we have… we increase to the bottom line, and we… you know, the revenue will go 10X, because it'll be retail, right? Almost. Almost, right?

1025
01:53:05.630 --> 01:53:06.790
Dieter Werwath: So we have a lot more…

1026
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:08.100
Anders Boye: higher revenue.

1027
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:09.260
Dieter Werwath: Exactly.

1028
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:13.280
Anders Boye: From alternatives, and that will fuel us for what we want to do for the core brand.

1029
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:15.259
Anders Boye: So we need to find that…

1030
01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:32.809
Anders Boye: almost compounding extra revenue that gives us while we're developing the brand can… it's almost like, you know, it's like the waitress in Beverly Hills wanting to be an actor… actress, right? So, the taxi driver starting to become

1031
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:34.549
Anders Boye: We need to…

1032
01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:41.169
Anders Boye: some extra income streams, and I think they're there, and because we have the systems now, we can add on to it.

1033
01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.919
Anders Boye: And, you know, it's just a little separate…

1034
01:53:45.170 --> 01:53:47.869
Anders Boye: business division, but in the same P&L.

1035
01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:49.160
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

1036
01:53:50.010 --> 01:53:51.799
Dieter Werwath: All feeding into the same account.

1037
01:53:51.800 --> 01:54:00.760
Anders Boye: I target high KPIs, if we can find the right salespeople that are driven by 20% in their pocket of what they sell, and then we just go crazy.

1038
01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:07.509
Dieter Werwath: And, you know, like I said, there's no… there's no real prescriptions there, there's no limits.

1039
01:54:09.930 --> 01:54:22.600
Dieter Werwath: What we would need to do is just get an additional MIB on our corporate license, but there's nothing… we're not looking to bring in alcohol at this stage. We're not looking to bring in any kind of

1040
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:39.119
Dieter Werwath: banned substances, or, you know, narcotics, or medication, or anything like that. There shouldn't be any problems in getting those licenses. They're reasonably straightforward and simple to apply for. I guess on that note, Provo's going nuts. He's making it very difficult

1041
01:54:39.490 --> 01:54:48.099
Dieter Werwath: to set up, to start new businesses, particularly for foreigners here. We should be fine because we're already established, but I was sat talking with a guy recently,

1042
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:51.330
Dieter Werwath: And, yeah, picking…

1043
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:59.959
Dieter Werwath: licensed channels and registration channels and stuff, it's getting more and more difficult. I don't know what he's…

1044
01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:02.239
Dieter Werwath: I don't know what's on his mind, to be honest.

1045
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.179
Anders Boye: Would we… our paid-up capital, are we gonna get into any.

1046
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:07.030
Dieter Werwath: son?

1047
01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:17.789
Dieter Werwath: No, that's not even been a cause for concern at all. Nobody seems to be checking on that. It's more about… he seems hell-bent on

1048
01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:21.790
Dieter Werwath: Making things more difficult to start new things.

1049
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:29.890
Anders Boye: It's really strange, yeah. See what's happening in the coal mines, it's absolutely crazy what's happened the last week, and

1050
01:55:30.730 --> 01:55:35.370
Anders Boye: basically, if you look at the biggest coal mines in Indonesia, he's taken away

1051
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:42.560
Anders Boye: What is… what is the equivalent of 15% of the exports

1052
01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:53.820
Anders Boye: of Indonesia being one of the biggest coal-exporting countries in the world, equivalent, on a year-to-year basis, on average, 2,000 shipments, 2,000 full ships.

1053
01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.420
Anders Boye: That it will have a huge impact on the freight market. Now.

1054
01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:04.009
Anders Boye: I'm in a very good position there, because my clients have not been…

1055
01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:08.689
Anders Boye: They maintain their levels as the only true miners in Indonesia.

1056
01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:15.420
Anders Boye: It will have an impact eventually, but that means they're sitting on coal, they can tender out on.

1057
01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:22.879
Anders Boye: that almost no one else can get their hands on. So I'm hoping that that can get me a little bit of wind in the sail, but

1058
01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:36.450
Anders Boye: it's… it's crazy what he's doing. I mean, one thing is all the oil pump plantation, which is reclaiming all the illegal stuff. If it truly is illegal, if there's been a lot of shit, fine. But the coal exports?

1059
01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:52.389
Anders Boye: he's basically… and I think it's a… it's a… it's nepotism playing out right now, and showing who's the boss, and obviously filling the cabinet with people who've attended the military school in central Java, yadda yadda, been on his team, and…

1060
01:56:52.610 --> 01:56:57.239
Anders Boye: He's basically using Donald Trump's playbook at the moment.

1061
01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.970
Dieter Werwath: That's… that's exactly what I was thinking. Yeah.

1062
01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:00.470
Anders Boye: So…

1063
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:01.659
Dieter Werwath: And it's a slippery…

1064
01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:13.649
Anders Boye: Yeah, in the shipping, I was talking this morning, we got reporters calling in, and there was a big cold conference in Delhi, everyone's panicking. I mean, you're talking about

1065
01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:19.890
Anders Boye: all of Asia's energy, is, to a large extent, supported by Indonesia.

1066
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:33.100
Anders Boye: And 15% of that has just been removed from the market. And some miners, including the wealthiest Indonesian guy, a couple of years ago, who owns Bayern Energy, he's lost 80% of his license.

1067
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:35.040
Dieter Werwath: 80%?

1068
01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:36.280
Anders Boye: Yep.

1069
01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:40.460
Anders Boye: So, yes, I'm a bit worried, because it's…

1070
01:57:40.930 --> 01:57:49.620
Anders Boye: I mean, you saw what happened in the stock markets, they… and it's fair enough that they're gonna increase the float of the publicly traded shares.

1071
01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:51.989
Anders Boye: From 5% to 15%, but…

1072
01:57:52.240 --> 01:58:02.830
Anders Boye: They forgot to read the memo that most share, most companies in Indonesia are floated only for one purpose, is to make the owners rich, not for other people to trade them.

1073
01:58:05.130 --> 01:58:15.040
Anders Boye: it's basically a credit facility for the rich families, right? The shares in Indonesia, and most of it is BCA anyway. So, of course it reacted when they opened up for it.

1074
01:58:17.630 --> 01:58:23.500
Dieter Werwath: I mean, I just don't understand how… this is a slippery slope back to the old days.

1075
01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:24.980
Anders Boye: Central Indonesia.

1076
01:58:25.170 --> 01:58:25.780
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

1077
01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:39.339
Anders Boye: And then, of course, you have anti… you have all the world's eyes on the Google guy, and all that, you know, playing out now, which is terrible, right?

1078
01:58:39.450 --> 01:58:51.719
Anders Boye: And Google actually getting involved in that now, because obviously he got arrested for being naughty, which probably never happened, but… And then the finance minister that was well-liked, no longer, right?

1079
01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:52.100
Dieter Werwath: Yeah.

1080
01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:54.729
Anders Boye: It is very worrying. It's very worrying.

1081
01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.069
Anders Boye: So, I think…

1082
01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:09.380
Anders Boye: going back to… to operating in Indonesia, you know, we could also look at an Indonesian partner for another entity under a part… a JV with Unisola, but

1083
01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:17.119
Anders Boye: Hopefully, we'll be fine, but let's clean up the… the records, before any more problems.

1084
01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:21.219
Anders Boye: I mean, at the end of the day, Indonesia needs foreign investment, they need companies.

1085
01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:21.800
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

1086
01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:33.549
Anders Boye: Whether he's gonna give all his mates the licensing deals, I don't know, but I'm just thinking of parallel importing and actually cornering the market on some popular products.

1087
01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:34.420
Dieter Werwath: Yes.

1088
01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:35.280
Anders Boye: default.

1089
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:37.950
Anders Boye: It shouldn't be difficult, I think.

1090
01:59:38.250 --> 01:59:42.670
Anders Boye: or just find one or two SKUs that we know we can

1091
01:59:43.090 --> 01:59:47.580
Anders Boye: That we can tweak a little bit, and actually make some money, or just do the…

1092
01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:52.919
Anders Boye: You know, the most boring thing in the world, and do what everyone else is doing, but just doing it a bit better.

1093
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:57.809
Anders Boye: and more interesting, I mean… but yeah, who knows?

1094
02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:09.529
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, let's see. Let's see. Right, I'm gonna go, because my youngest daughter is sick, and she's just been stood at the door with tears in her eyes again. She can't sleep.

1095
02:00:09.690 --> 02:00:10.450
Anders Boye: Okay, Dean.

1096
02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:16.659
Dieter Werwath: But yes, I'll get a rough draft of this ready for tomorrow, share it over, and then…

1097
02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:19.910
Dieter Werwath: We didn't actually set a time yet.

1098
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:20.305
Anders Boye: Oh.

1099
02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:21.859
Dieter Werwath: The other contribution.

1100
02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:22.859
Anders Boye: I haven't.

1101
02:00:23.250 --> 02:00:28.719
Dieter Werwath: So, I think… did Al say he was traveling this week and back on Sunday?

1102
02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:32.220
Anders Boye: Can't recall. I think, isn't he going to Japan soon?

1103
02:00:33.890 --> 02:00:46.159
Dieter Werwath: Yeah. But to be honest, I mean, we can share it with them anyway. We'll take a quick look at it ourselves, we can share it with them, ask for feedback, and go from there, and then get on a call when we can all make it ASAP.

1104
02:00:46.530 --> 02:01:00.369
Anders Boye: Yeah, I would love for Ryan, if you could do a deck, a pitch deck for new accounts with what he has on hand. Yeah. That simple one, right? Because we have so many… we have pretty good photos now, we have a couple of videos we can add into a PDF.

1105
02:01:01.050 --> 02:01:01.690
Dieter Werwath: Yep.

1106
02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:06.200
Anders Boye: But I have a few guys asking me if we could send something over.

1107
02:01:08.250 --> 02:01:10.109
Anders Boye: Just like a sales deck, right?

1108
02:01:10.530 --> 02:01:19.749
Dieter Werwath: Yeah, and I think, you know, just highlighting our USPs, and one of those is our approach. I don't know how we put that into writing yet, but I think that that's something that's important to call out.

1109
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:20.570
Anders Boye: Hmm.

1110
02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:23.930
Anders Boye: Alright, okay, D.

1111
02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.740
Dieter Werwath: Cool. Thank you, Anders. Enjoy the rest of the evening. I'll speak to you soon.

1112
02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:29.699
Anders Boye: Bye, bye.

1113
02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:30.850
Dieter Werwath: Bye-bye, bye-bye.
