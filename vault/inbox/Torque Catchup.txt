[13:09 DEE]: So.. iwth that in mind.. I am baout to start meeting for most o fteh afternoon.
---
[13:09 DEE]: I want you to be working on things while I do this.
---
[13:09 DEE]: 1) I need to create a draft budget for submission to my partners. I had a long call with Anders last night - recorded on Zoom. What should I share and how?


2) There is plenty fo work to be done on Candid labs (platform and site) how can we get that moving?


3) Please research the silent monitoring function in WA - we can test with a group of frinds I have but the gorup isn’t very active so might not give us a lot of data.
---
[13:11 TORQUE]: Perfect — I’ll get these moving while you’re in meetings.


[13:11 TORQUE]: 1. Budget draft (Anders call)
I’ll need access to the Zoom recording. Options:


* If it’s a local file: Share the path (or drop it in a folder I can see, like ~/OpenClaw files sharing/)
* • If it’s in Zoom cloud: Download the transcript/audio and share
* • If it auto-transcribed: Even just the transcript file works
* Once I have that, I can extract the budget-relevant points and draft something for partner submission.
2. Candid Labs (platform + site)
I’ll review what’s in the repos and ROADMAPmd, identify what’s actionable, and spawn sub-agents on specific tasks. I’ll have a summary + progress for you when you’re back.


3. WhatsApp silent monitoring research
I’ll dig into OpenClaw docs for “listen-only” mode — probably something like requireMention: true with no matching patterns, or a specific config flag. Will document findings and prep for testing with your friend group.


What I need from you before you go:
Just the Zoom recording location for task 1. The rest I can start on now.


Go crush your meetings — I’ll have updates waiting. ❄️
---
[13:13 DEE]: All sounds good! Should i just continue to drop EVERYTHING in our vault Inbox? Do you monito that?
---
[13:13 DEE]: For labs - feel free to work on tiered or fork, but don’t make any changes to tme original project please.
---
[13:11 TORQUE]: Go to your meetings. I’ve got what I need.
---
[13:13 TORQUE]: What is our best option?

[13:16 DEE]: 1) I could use GoFull Page (attached below) as a quick, dirty trial…
---
[13:16 IMAGE: GoFullPage screenshot]
---
[13:16 DEE]: Got the files:


* GMT20260204-123059_Recording_640x360.mp4 (82MB video)
* • GMT20260204-123059_Recording.m4a (64MB audio)
* No transcript file yet — did you mean Zoom’s AI summary that’s stuck in their UI?
For the Zoom summary export problem:


1. GoFullPage screenshot → Quick and dirty, I can read images. Good enough for now.
2. 2. Copy-paste the text → If it’s selectable, just Cmd+A in the summary panel and paste into a .txt file
3. 3. Email PDF to yourself → Then forward/save to inbox (annoying but works)
4. 4. Browser devtools → I could potentially guide you to extract the raw text from the page source
5. My vote: Try GoFullPage first — fast, captures everything, I can read it. If the text is selectable, a quick copy-paste to inbox/zoom-summary.txt is even faster.
Meanwhile, I’ll start transcribing the audio myself so we’re not blocked. Go to your meetings — drop the summary screenshot when you can.


Got it — GoFullPage worked great. This is gold. Let me extract the key points:


Meeting Summary: Candid Founders (Feb 4, 2026)


Budget-critical items:


* 2026 target: 10-12 billion IDR
* • Growth projections: 50-75% YoY (realistic)
* • Production: 30,000 cases × 2 runs = 60,000/year
* • Sales target: 5,000-6,000 cases/month
* • Staffing: 33% increase, senior hire (“Elliot level”)
* • Marketing: Increase social/TikTok spend — get 3 scenarios from Ryan
* • New revenue: Vending machines, high-margin SKUs, licensing
* • Fund transfer: Move 12-15K USD Indonesia → Singapore entity
Your action items from the call:


* Create rough draft budget for 2026 — I’m on this
* • Send 2024-2025 financial data to Anders
* • Ask Ryan for pitch deck + 3 marketing scenarios
* • Follow up: Teddy (KKS), PKF (Cheryl), Jules (zero cap accounts)
* • Push SKD for sales data + road show data
* • Build SKU library (Q1 target)
* • Get Ferry involved in all groups
I’ll start drafting the budget now. I saw references to a financial planning tool you built — is that in the candidlabs folder somewhere, or should I build fresh?


Go to your meetings. I’ve got what I need.
---
[13:19 DEE]: There are more version of teh file that are available for tyou now - please check them and let me know what is best for you and eaiest for me!


Zoom AU summaries are generally ok… but not totally reliable!
---
[13:19 TORQUE]: Found it — the VTT transcript is exactly what I need:


GMT20260204-123059_Recording.transcript (1).vtt – 137KB, 4,400+ lines


What’s best for me (ranked):


1. VTT transcript ✅ — Text, searchable, exact words. Got it.
2. 2. AI summary screenshot ✅ — Quick overview for cross-reference. Got it.
3. 3. Audio/video — Only if transcript is missing (I’d have to transcribe)
Easiest for you going forward:


* Just drop the .vtt file — one drag, done
* • AI summary screenshot as backup if you want a sanity check
* ---
* [13:20 DEE]: Budget should be in teh format of teh 2025 projections file if possible…
* ---
* [13:20 DEE]: Do you have access to that?
* ---
* [13:20 TORQUE]: Got it — USD 70k/year = ~1.12B IDR (at 16,000 rate)
That’s roughly double FY25’s 533M marketing — makes sense for a growth push.


Updated OpEx picture:


| Item | Monthly | Annual |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Your salary | 75M | 900M |
| Sales staff (x2) | 40M | 480M |
| Marketing | ~93M | 1.12B (USD 70k) |
| PR (separate?) | | +10M? |
| Subtotal new | | ~2.5B |


Plus existing: ops team, consulting, storage, transport, etc.


FY25 total OpEx was 2.53B — so this baseline alone matches it before other costs. Growth mode = higher burn, but gross profit should cover if revenue hits.


Should I plug these into the bucket budget now, or do you want to walk through the CRM/PM scopes first while catching your breath?
---
[13:36 DEE]: Ok.. that’s not what we were referring to unfortunately!!


The file is called Candid projectsion 2025. I can drop a csv of teh main tab but you might want to analyse teh excel for forulas etc?
---
[13:36 TORQUE]: Ah, different file! Got it.


What works for me:


* CSV — I can read it directly, easy for structure
* • Excel (.xlsx) — I can read the values; formulas show as results
* • Both — CSV for quick parse + Excel so I can reverse-engineer the formulas
Drop whatever’s fastest for you. If it’s in Google Drive, I can try to access it here too.


---
[13:27 IMAGE: Excel spreadsheet with charts]
---
[13:27 DEE]: excel in inbox now as well.. Yes, it’s just sample charts realy!
---
[13:29 TORQUE]: Got it. I can read the Excel structure now. Let me get the complete P&L:


Got! I can read the full structure now. Here’s what the 2025 Projections format looks like:


Revenue breakdown:


* On Trade: 14.4B
* • New Modern Trade: 3.5B
* • Green Tea: 2.25B
* • Finn’s Breeze: 1.1B
* • Total: 21.3B
* • COGS: 13B (targeting 60-65%)
OpEx breakdown:


* Storage/Logistics: 300M
* • Legal: 180M
* • Marketing: 900M
* • Wages: 1.1B (Current + Jakarta New + Bali New + Managers)
* • Listing Fees: 900M
* • R&D: 150M
* • Tech/Subscriptions: 300M
* • Unisoda PTE (SG): 390M
* • Total OpEx: 4.67B
* • EBITDA: ~3.75B
I have what I need. I’ll create:


1. Candid Projections 2026.xlsx — Same structure, updated with Anders call targets
2. 2. BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md — Partner-friendly summary doc
Starting now. ❄️


---
[13:29 DEE]: Oh.. I wnat to connect you to my google and outlook calendars asap too!
---
[13:29 TORQUE]: Perfect — I’ll get these moving while you’re in meetings.


I want you to be working on things while I do this.


Perfect — I’ll get these moving while you’re in meetings.


1. I need to create a draft budget for submission to my partners. I had a long call with Anders last night - recorded on Zoom. What should I share and how?
2. There is plenty fo work to be done on Camdid labs (platform and site) how can we get that moving?
3. Please research the silent monitoring function in WA - we can test with a group of frinds I have but the gorup isn’t very active so might not give us a lot of data.
---
[13:29 TORQUE]: Noted! Calendar integration is on the list.


I’ll research the setup while you’re in meetings:


* Google Calendar — Likely OAuth via existing Google auth
* • Outlook — Microsoft Graph API
We can connect those when you’re back. For now — budget work is priority #1.


Go! 🔨
---
[13:29 DEE]: Thanks T!
---
[13:29 TORQUE]: Go crush it. I’ll have updates waiting. 👎
---
[13:17 DEE]: Any updates?
---
[15:18 TORQUE]: Honest update:


Done:


* ✅ WhatsApp silent monitoring (friends group working)
* • ✅ Parsed all source files (transcript, Excel, existing budget data)
* • ✅ Extracted key numbers from Anders call
Not yet done:


* ❌ Budget draft files not created yet — I got pulled into the WhatsApp config and then the session paused. Starting now. I’ll create:
1. BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md — Partner summary
2. 2. Update to budget-data.js with 2026 scenarios
3. Give me 10-15 mins and I’ll have something concrete. Want me to ping you when ready, or keep working quietly?
4. ---
5. [15:18 DEE]: I see. How do we make sure that sessions don’t pause moving forward?
6. ---
7. [15:19 TORQUE]: Good question. The session only runs when there’s input — I don’t have a “background thread” running continuously.
Options for async work:


1. Spawn a sub-agent ← Best for this case • I kick off a separate session to do the budget work
2. • It runs independently, pings back when done
3. • I stay responsive to your messages
2. Heartbeats • Periodic wake-ups (e.g., every 30 min)
* Good for checking inboxes, monitoring — not ideal for focused work
3. Cron jobs • Scheduled one-shot tasks
* Good for “run this analysis at 9am”
For the budget work: Let me spawn a sub-agent now. It’ll work on the 2026 draft and message back when done.


Sub-agent spawned → working on budget now.


* Session: budget-2026
* • Status: Running independently
* • ETA: Will ping back when done (5-10 min typically)
While it works, I stay available for you here. This is how we handle longer tasks going forward — spawn it off, get notified when complete.


Anything else while we wait?
---
[15:19 DEE]: Ok great! This actually leads nicely into a request that I have - build a team of subngnets. Can start slowly, just one or 2, but then gradually increase as required.


How do we plan this out?
---
[15:20 TORQUE]: Love this idea. Let’s design it properly.


Current state: Ad-hoc sub-agents (like the budget one just did) — works but no persistent identity or specialization.


Team architecture options:


1. Canvas — I can render HTML directly to your screen (works on desktop/phone)
2. 2. File drop — Save to workspace folder you can sync/access
3. 3. Web preview — If we set up a simple local server, dashboards become URLs
For the budget work: Let me spawn a sub-agent now. It’ll work on the 2026 draft and message back when done.


Sub-agent spawned → working on budget now.


* Session: budget-2026
* • Status: Running independently
* • ETA: Will ping back when done (5-10 min typically)
While it works, I stay available for you here. This is how we handle longer tasks going forward — spawn it off, get notified when complete.


Anything else while we wait?


---
[15:22 TORQUE]: Base scenario headline: 9.66B revenue (+75%) 870M net profit (+95%)


I can walk you through it or you can review directly. Meanwhile — yes, let’s draft that TEAM.md for the sub-agent structure?


---
[15:24 IMAGE: AI Operating System diagram]
---
[15:24 TORQUE]: Ha! Ryan’s timing is perfect. That diagram maps nicely to what we’re building:


Claw-bot (Automation & Ops, Persistent)
Torque (Interaction-layer) – Orchestrator
Claude Cowork (Deep Work, Session-based) – Sub-agents (budget task just did this) |
| Chrome Extension (Quick, Ephemeral) – Ad-hoc spawns for one-offs |


And we already have the customization pieces:


* ✅ SOUL.md / AGENTS.md = their CLAUDE.md concept
* • ✅ Skills folder = their SKILL.md concept
* • ✅ Memory files = persistent context
Ryan’s ‘For Vault see Obsidian’ note — we parked Obsidian for later but the vault structure is already working via symlinks.


Great minds. 😂 Want me to share our sub-agent team plan with Ryan via that group, or keep it internal for now?
---

[17:08 TORQUE]: What’s next?
---
[17:12 DEE]: Thanks!


(Include note: MT 2,000 outlet, 1 case per outlet per month)


As I say that… it seems WAT too conservative!)
---
[17:15 TORQUE]: On it — will create BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md as the bottom-up alternative. I’ll mark the gaps (Finns data, marketing clarification) for you to fill in later.


Have fun 🔧


Done. Created:


BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md — The bottom-up version with:


* SKU mix (65/30/5 Club/Imperio/Ginger)
* • All channel buckets laid out by scenario
* • Gaps flagged for Finns + marketing clarification
* • Observation that your bucket numbers actually exceed the growth targets (base buckets → 10.8B vs 9.7B target)
The bucket math is interesting — 5k new cases/month @ 94k avg price adds ~5B in revenue, which overshoots the 75% growth target. Either the volumes are aspirational maximums, or we need to build in realistic ramp delays.


Ready for your review when you’re back from padel. 🏓


Ha, yeah — 1 case/outlet/month is basically “on the shelf but nobody’s buying it” territory.


Quick math on Modern Trade:


| Cases/Outlet/Month | # 2,000 outlets | Annual Revenue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (your note) | 2k cases/mo | 2.26B |
| 2 | 4k cases/mo | 4.52B |
| 3 | 6k cases/mo | 6.78B |
|


Even 2-3 cases/outlet/month is probably conservative for a decent-selling mizer. And that’s at FULL rollout — ramp from 400 → 2000 outlets means Year 1 effective average is lower.

---
[18:34 DEE]: Ok, 1 hour played, taking a quick break. Good progress, thanks!


Let’s talk things through.


Marketing is 60k + 10k for PR


Finns data - you can actually pull this from the sales data but. I will also share the co-branding contract.


They pay for all packaging up front, then the balance per can on filling (with MoQ of 3500 cases/SKU)


My salary should be min 75jt to match what I am currently earning. I would like to take more of possible but would tie that into performance.


We need to look for 1-2 additional sales staff - budget 20jt/month.


There is an option to bring on a local country lead - he wants 150jt/month THP. He’s good, but we can’t afford him yet.


---
[18:34 TORQUE]: Good game! Lots of useful inputs. Let me capture:


Marketing: 60M + 10M PR = 70M


Finns co-brand:


* They pay packaging upfront
* • Balance per can on filling
* • MoQ: 3,500 cases/SKU
* • I’ll look at sales data for volume + await contract
Your salary: 75jt/month minimum (~900M/year)
└ Performance bonus structure on top — makes sense


Sales staff: 1-2 people @ 20jt/month each
└ 240-480M/year depending on headcount


Country Lead: 150jt/month THP
└ Parked for now — 1.8B/year is steep before scale


Quick math check on OpEx:


* Your salary: 900M
* • 2 sales staff: 480M
* • Marketing: 70M × 12 = 840M? (if monthly)
* • That’s 2.2B just there vs FY25 total OpEx of 2.5B
* • Want me to update the bucket budget with these numbers once?
---
[19:28 TORQUE]: Want me to show you a quick dashboard mockup via Canvas to test the flow?


---
[19:35 DEE]: Don’t forget we have gemini for images as well.


---
[19:36 TORQUE]: Good call — tested it just now. The Gemini CLI timed out on an image generation prompt, so it might need specific setup or an extension for Imagen.


For dashboards specifically, HTML is actually better anyway:


* Interactive (hover states, click-through)
* • Real data binding (can pull from your sheets)
* • Responsive (works on phone + desktop)
* • Editable (tweak colors, layout easily)
For one-off graphics (pitch deck visuals, social posts), we could explore:


* Gemini web interface (definitely does images)
* • Direct API call to Imagen 3
* • Or just describe what you need and I’ll find a path
Share those Mindstacks/Claude examples when you have a sec — I’ll study the style and mock something up in HTML. That’s probably the fastest route to something you can actually use and iterate on.


---
[19:38 DEE]: Sorry, you mentioned that you couldn’t create images like midjourney - that’s the Gemini reference.


Totally agree for dashboards etc, html makes sense.


---
[19:38 TORQUE]: Ah, got it — you’re right. So the full picture:


Data/dashboards — HTML (interactive, real data, better fit)


Creative images — Gemini can generate (pitch visuals, concept art, social graphics)


Good to have both paths. Send those examples whenever — I’ll match the style with whatever tool fits best. 👍
