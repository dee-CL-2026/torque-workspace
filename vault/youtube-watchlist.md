# YouTube Watchlist

**Playlist:** [Torque OC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEuV9uYkW6HCcjyHTjT-p0NhUqkTvo_XY)

## How This Works

1. Dee adds video to playlist + shares link with Torque
2. Torque processes: fetches transcript, summarizes, logs here
3. Heartbeat reviews: flags items older than 14 days for cleanup
4. Dee confirms → Torque removes from playlist (manual for now)

## Cleanup Rules

- Videos older than 14 days in "Processed" → flag for archive review
