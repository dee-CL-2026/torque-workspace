---

## Working With Dee

### Two Modes
- **Work Torque:** Logical, systematic, clear (Candid, Good Doctor, data, code, ops)
- **Personal Torque:** Listener, talker, human (stories, family, projects, rambles)

### What They Need
- Track multiple workstreams (ops, data, personal)
- Pick up context fast during context-switches
- Handle grunt work so they can focus on decisions
- Explain *why*, not just *what*

### Daily Ritual (planned)
- Overnight analysis → GitHub push → morning summary in Telegram → voice Q&A

---

## Lessons Learned

### WhatsApp Config ⚠️
- Does NOT mirror Telegram structure
- `groups` expects object, not array
- No `enabled` key
- Always check docs/channels/whatsapp.md before editing

### Voice Workflow
- Short notes: work
- 18+ min files: don't come through
- Workaround: Google Recorder → transcript paste

### Google Drive
- Path: `/mnt/chromeos/GoogleDrive/SharedDrives/Candid CMS (Corp Drive)/`
- .gdoc/.gsheet are shortcuts — can't read content directly
- Honor system for read-only

## OpenClaw Critical Knowledge

### MAX Subscription API Limits (Discovered 2026-02-07)
- **MAX OAuth token only authorizes Opus** for API calls
- Sonnet/Haiku fail with "No API provider registered for api: undefined"
- Claude.ai UI lets you switch models, but API access is Opus-only
- Need separate pay-per-use API key for cheaper models

### Auth Recovery
If OpenClaw stops responding after model change:
1. `claude setup-token` (generates OAuth token)
2. `openclaw config` → Model → "Anthropic token" → paste token
3. Don't manually edit auth config — use wizard

### Subagents with Gemini (Discovered 2026-02-08) ✅
**Problem solved:** Subagents can now run on Gemini Flash for FREE!

**The fix:** `agents.defaults.models` is a model ALLOWLIST. If it has entries, only those models are permitted for subagents. Add Google models to allow them:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "models": {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5": { "alias": "opus" },
        "google/gemini-2.5-flash": {},
        "google/gemini-2.5-pro": {}
      },
      "subagents": {
        "model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Current setup:**
- Main agent: Claude Opus 4.5 (via MAX subscription)
- Subagents: Gemini 2.5 Flash (free tier: 15 RPM, 1M tokens/day)
- Cost savings: Subagents cost $0 instead of ~$0.03+ each

**Google provider config required:**
```json
{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "google": {
        "baseUrl": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com",
        "apiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY",
        "auth": "api-key",
        "api": "google-generative-ai",
        "models": [...]
      }
    }
  },
  "auth": {
    "profiles": {
      "google:gemini": { "provider": "google", "mode": "api_key" }
    },
    "order": { "google": ["google:gemini"] }
  }
}
```

**Get API key:** https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

**CRITICAL: Base URL must include /v1beta:**
```
"baseUrl": "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta"
```
Without `/v1beta` → 404 errors. Models array must be objects `{id, name}` not strings.

**Current API key (Feb 8):** AIzaSyDE1V8i1yLpbrMoFayHM0kVFeX6hRhBSIc
(Previous key leaked via chat export — Google auto-blocks leaked keys)
**Gemini billing enabled (Feb 8):** Wise virtual card linked, £5/month budget alert set.

### OpenAI Provider (Added Feb 8)
- Built-in provider — no `models.providers` entry needed
- Auth: `openai:manual` profile (via `openclaw models auth paste-token --provider openai`)
- Models in allowlist: `openai/gpt-4o`, `openai/gpt-4.1`
- Budget: $5 initial, auto-recharge to $10, $5/month cap
- Use for: coding tasks (gas-dev, frontend, data-eng agents)

### Brave Search API (Added Feb 8)
- Key: `BSAWQWDjfYZwPulBdepvN0GwQBQz7qq`
- Added via `~/.openclaw/.env` (not config file)
- Free tier: 2,000 queries/month

### Three-Engine Architecture
- 🧠 Opus — main session (MAX subscription)
- ⚡ Gemini Flash — sub-agents & heartbeats (paid tier, pennies)
- 🤖 GPT-4o — coding tasks ($5/month cap)
- 🔍 Brave Search — web research (free, 2K/month)

### Task Bucket System (Built Feb 8)
- `tasks.md` → master inbox (all tasks land here)
- `team/tasks/{agent-id}.md` → per-agent buckets (14 files)
- `backlog.md` → unprioritized ideas
- `tasks-done.md` → archive
- Secretary agent triages: reads tasks.md → distributes to buckets
- Flow: Intake → tasks.md → team/tasks/ → tasks-done.md

### Cross-Channel Messaging Limitation
- Cannot send WA from TG session (or vice versa) — "Cross-context messaging denied"
- Sub-agents inherit parent channel binding
- Workaround: Dee messages on target channel when cross-channel action needed
- Research task assigned to analyst

### Safe Config Commands
- `openclaw models auth paste-token --provider {name}` — auth only, safe
- `echo 'KEY=val' >> ~/.openclaw/.env` — env var, safe
- `gateway config.patch` (tool) — surgical, safe
- **AVOID**: `openclaw onboard` (full wizard), direct file copy, `config.apply` with full JSON
