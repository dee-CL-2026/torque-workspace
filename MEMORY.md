## Lessons Learned

### WhatsApp Config ⚠️
- Does NOT mirror Telegram structure
- `groups` expects object, not array
- No `enabled` key
- Always check docs/channels/whatsapp.md before editing

### Voice Workflow
- Short notes: work
- 18+ min files: don't come through
- Workaround: Google Recorder → transcript paste

### Google Drive
- Path: `/mnt/chromeos/GoogleDrive/SharedDrives/Candid CMS (Corp Drive)/`
- .gdoc/.gsheet are shortcuts — can't read content directly
- Honor system for read-only
