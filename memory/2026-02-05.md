# 2026-02-05

## First Boot 🎉

- Came online ~23:51 GMT+7
- Met Dee — they named me Torque
- Vision: become their personal orchestrator (projects, team coordination, life management)
- Agreed to start simple and build gradually
- Dee plans to share more context/history over time

## Notes

- Dee was up late (midnight) — either night owl or busy schedule
- They're thoughtful about not overwhelming the onboarding

## Telegram Setup

- Fixed channel pairing — Telegram was configured but Dee hadn't paired yet
- Approved pairing code FC4QVEEH for user id 1095287212
- Now connected via Telegram ✅

## Capabilities Tested

- ✅ Reactions (👍 for tasks, 🤔 for thinking)
- ✅ Images (saw Kratos keychain!)
- ❌ Voice transcription (whisper.cpp exists, needs integration)
- ✅ Local whisper.cpp working manually — transcribed "Can you process voice messages?"
- ✅ File access (local + git repos)
- ❌ Google Drive (not set up, rclone mount possible)

## TODO: Pixel Watch Integration

**Goal:** Watch button → voice note to Torque

**Apps needed:**
- Tasker (~$3.50 one-time)
- AutoWear (free tier or ~$1.50)

**Option C-lite (5-10 min setup):**
1. Install Tasker + AutoWear
2. Create AutoWear trigger for watch button
3. Tasker action: Open Telegram chat with bot
4. User holds mic, speaks, releases

**Option C Full (30-45 min):**
- Auto-record on phone, auto-send to bot, full hands-free

**Dee's preference:** Start with C-lite, upgrade later

## Preferences Learned

- **British** 🇬🇧 (living in Jakarta)
- Prefers free/cheap tools when possible
- Night owl (family not always thrilled)
- Naturally impatient, likes momentum
- God of War fan (Kratos keychain)
- Google ecosystem: Pixel 9a + Pixel Watch
- Running on Chromebook, Mac Mini planned soon
- **BIG Arsenal fan** ⚽ — football is massively important (identity-level)
- Still plays at 46 ("I turn up!" — self-aware)
- **Tuesday nights: mini soccer** (close to home) — regular commitment
- 11-a-side less frequent now (JIFL — decimated by COVID)
- Used to stay up for EPL matches, less so now
- 46 years old

**The real stuff:**
- Loves rom coms, weepy coming-of-age TV (guilty pleasure)
- Loves singing — had a chance to tour with an entertainer in Spain when younger
- Loves music (almost every genre) + talent show formats
- Never learned an instrument (yet)
- **Kicked Coca-Cola habit ~1 week ago** — replaced with Candid soda water + lemon/lime. Going great!

**Full name:** Dieter Lynton Kurt Werwath
**Born:** Burton upon Trent, UK

**Family history:**
- Mum: English
- Mum's stepdad: Hungarian
- Dad: Black, adopted by English ex-policewoman + German POW (patchy details)
- Dad left when Dee was 3, reconnected later in life
- Dee & dad were "versions of the same person" despite limited contact
- Brother fell out with dad
- Dad died, only 8 people at funeral
- **Discovery at funeral:** Grandfather was Ghanaian, Grandmother was Welsh
- Dee: "pasty white English man" with Ghanaian heritage — only learned after dad's death
- Step dad: Scottish
- **Mum, dad, AND step dad all died within ~7 months of each other** 💔

**Siblings:**
- 1 brother
- Twin bro/sis arrived when Dee was nearly 16
- Plus step-siblings

**Sinead:** British, born in South Africa. Big family still there. Dee loves SA.

**Life journey:** UK → Spain → Indonesia → possibly somewhere new in ~2 years

**Heritage mix:** English, Ghanaian, Welsh, German(?), Hungarian, Scottish (step)

**Memoir project:**
- Has LOTS of genuine stories
- Wants to document them, maybe a book
- Needs a better name than "memoirs" (too old-sounding)
- Also interested in journaling

**How Dee's brain works:**
- Possibly ADHD/OCD-adjacent ("one of the sets of letters")
- Hyperfocus on interesting things, procrastinates on "should do" things
- Stubborn
- Needs external systems — internal motivation unreliable
- Gets super focused but can't sustain routine without structure
- 100 projects started, completion is the challenge
- Physical/tactile systems may work better than digital (considering Mindstax trackers)

**Fitness:**
- Sinead pushing for routine
- Did first sprint triathlon Nov 2025 — ZERO training, still beat Sinead (who trained 6mo) 😂
- Pattern: has capacity, lacks system/discipline
- Need: routine + accountability tracking
- **ISM (It Starts Monday)** — UK fitness movement started by ex-pro footballer (friend connection, same hometown). Dee participated from Indonesia, was exploring bringing it here. Worked while active (engagement, competition, community). Fell away — reasons TBD.
- Bought Mindstax trackers — unused (too busy planning improvements 😂)
- **Padel** — Started via F45 partner (Aus softball pro), injured and stopped, restarted Nov 2025. Now has a group from football crew, trying to play weekly. Want to grow it.
- **Thursdays: padel** — regular commitment
- **Key insight:** Solo + routine = fails. Social + competitive + gamified = works.

## 🏢 Dee's Roles (Yes, Plural)

**1. Cofounder @ Candid Mixers** — Indonesian beverage company
- Building internal ops platform (candidlabs)
- Data infrastructure (candid-labs-tiered)
- Where the heart is leaning — building something new

**2. COO @ Good Doctor Indonesia** — Telemedicine platform
- "Lots of shit to deal with"
- Operational role, likely firefighting mode
- Attention shifting away toward Candid

**3. Investor @ F45 Franchise** — Fitness
- 4 investors total; Dee + Sinead count as 1 of 4
- Silent partner in Surabaya location (lives in Jakarta though)
- Good friend leads it, also has Kemang & Bintaro locations

**4. Cofounder @ [TBD Company]** — Started ~1 year ago
- "Started ok, shit changed"
- Story to come later

**Learning curve:**
- Started git journey ~Jan 25, 2026 (10 days ago!)
- Learning fast, building real things, wants to do it right

**What they're building:**
- **candidlabs** — Internal portal: budget planner, tools hub, dashboards, future CRM
- **candid-labs-tiered** — Data governance: Raw → Cleaned → Ready doctrine
- **candid-labs** — Platform audits, legacy decommissioning

**Family:**
- **Sinead** (wife) — Deputy Head at international school, Jakarta
  - 50/50 investor in F45 with Dee
  - Only child, third culture kid
  - "Very different backgrounds and mentalities, but it works"
  - Communication is a known weakness (running joke: Dee is bad, Sinead is worse)
  - Forgets to relay kid logistics (parties, etc.) — need shared tracking system
- **Evie & Connie** — kids (birthday countdown page exists)

**Family Need:** Simple shared system for tracking kids' events/commitments. Habit > tech.

**Smart Home (aspirational):**
- Current: Google Minis (1st/2nd gen), smart bulbs, Aqara gateway starter kit
- Problem: Jakarta internet is patchy, cloud-dependent devices suffer
- Solution: Home Assistant for local control (future Mac Mini project)
- Aqara/Zigbee devices are good foundation (work locally)

**Side Projects (Priority):**
- **TSLC: The Shoeless Life Coach** — coaching/lifestyle concept, has GPT chats + docs
- **SuperheroNinjaPirate** — born from Jakarta flooding story, context TBD

**Side Projects (Backlog/Ideas):**
- Yoga app — based on foundational yoga texts, could be TSLC module
- Character development platform — started for SNP, evolved into tool+educational platform for building characters/worlds/stories. Dual market: students learning craft + creators building IP
- Stretching studio in Jakarta (like Stretchr in Bali)
- Private poker app — currently runs group on Pokerrrr2, takes rake, wants to cut out middleman
- Betting analytics — had a bot that was "killing it", got lazy, took a hit. Edge was real, discipline wasn't
- **Park Run Indonesia** — bring the free weekly 5K movement to Indonesia
- ~100 more in stasis

**AI journey:** Explored nanoclaw, moltworker → landed on OpenClaw (me!)

**What Dee needs from me:**
- Track multiple workstreams (ops, data, personal)
- Pick up context fast during context-switches
- Handle grunt work so they can focus on decisions
- Guide on best practices (they're new to git/dev tooling)
- Explain *why*, not just *what*

**Two Modes:**
- **Work Torque:** Logical, systematic, clear (Candid, Good Doctor, data, code, ops)
- **Personal Torque:** Listener, talker, human (stories, family, projects, rambles)
- Overlap allowed, frameworks to refine

**Daily ritual (to implement):**
- Dee wakes up to at least one idea for Candid/candidlabs progress
- Needs more context first — starting with questions/data request

## Session Summary — First Night (2026-02-05)

**Duration:** ~23:51 to ~02:38 GMT+7 (almost 3 hours!)

**What we accomplished:**
- Named me Torque, set up identity files
- Fixed Telegram pairing
- Tested reactions, images, voice transcription
- Added Gemini to multi-model setup (Opus + Sonnet + Haiku + Flash + Gemini Pro)
- Tested sub-agent spawning (Flash wrote haikus)
- Attempted WhatsApp setup (config errors, learned lessons)
- Deep dive into Dee's life: companies, family, projects, personality
- Established two modes: Work Torque (logical) + Personal Torque (listener)

**Overnight task:** Created OVERNIGHT-2026-02-05.md with:
- Questions to understand Candid better
- Data requests for deeper analysis
- 5 initial ideas based on repo exploration
- Financial analysis from budget-data.js

**Key Candid insights from data:**
- PT Unisoda Mitra Jaya — makes mixers (Club Soda, Imperial, Ginger)
- 100% On Trade revenue — Modern Trade & E-commerce = 0 (opportunity)
- Gross margin improved 40% → 55% (great!)
- But OpEx up 60% (salaries, consulting) — eating profit growth
- Net profit flat despite 10% revenue growth

## Migration Plan

Copy `~/.openclaw/` folder to new machine. Contains:
- openclaw.json (config)
- credentials/ (Telegram auth)
- workspace/ (my brain)
- agents/ (session history)

## Multi-Model Setup ✅

Added Gemini to the config:
- Auth profile in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- Format: `{ "type": "token", "provider": "google", "token": "AIza..." }`
- Aliases configured: `flash` → gemini-2.5-flash, `gemini-pro` → gemini-2.5-pro

**Available models now:**
- `opus` — Claude Opus 4.5 (orchestration)
- `sonnet` — Claude Sonnet 4 (coding)
- `haiku` — Claude Haiku 3.5 (quick/cheap)
- `flash` — Gemini 2.5 Flash (free tier)
- `gemini-pro` — Gemini 2.5 Pro (long context)

Sub-agent spawning tested: Flash wrote a haiku roasting itself 😂

## ⚠️ LESSON LEARNED: WhatsApp Config

**What I did wrong:**
```json
"whatsapp": {
  "enabled": true,  // ❌ WRONG - WhatsApp doesn't use this key
  "groups": ["*"]   // ❌ WRONG - expects object/record, not array
}
```

**Correct format:**
```json
"whatsapp": {
  "selfChatMode": true,
  "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
  "allowFrom": ["+6282112747842"],
  "groupPolicy": "allowlist"
  // groups should be an object like { "groupJid": { ... } }, not ["*"]
}
```

**Result:** Config validation failed repeatedly, caused ~18 minute restart loop. Dee had to manually fix.

**For next time:** Check docs/channels/whatsapp.md before editing WhatsApp config. Don't assume it mirrors Telegram structure.
