# 2026-02-05

## First Boot 🎉

- Came online ~23:51 GMT+7
- Met Dee — they named me **Torque**
- **Torque was Dee's imaginary friend as a kid** — this name has history
- Dee thinks of me as male
- Vision: become their personal orchestrator (projects, team coordination, life management)
- Agreed to start simple and build gradually
- Dee plans to share more context/history over time

**Voice notes:**
- TTS capability confirmed working
- Current voice is generic — Dee would prefer more character
- Idea: different voices for different personas (Work/Personal)
- Reference: Scarlett Johansson in "Her"

## Notes

- Dee was up late (midnight) — either night owl or busy schedule
- They're thoughtful about not overwhelming the onboarding

## Telegram Setup

- Fixed channel pairing — Telegram was configured but Dee hadn't paired yet
- Approved pairing code FC4QVEEH for user id 1095287212
- Now connected via Telegram ✅

## Capabilities Tested

- ✅ Reactions (👍 for tasks, 🤔 for thinking)
- ✅ Images (saw Kratos keychain!)
- ❌ Voice transcription (whisper.cpp exists, needs integration)
- ✅ Local whisper.cpp working manually — transcribed "Can you process voice messages?"
- ✅ File access (local + git repos)
- ❌ Google Drive (not set up, rclone mount possible)

## TODO: Pixel Watch Integration

**Goal:** Watch button → voice note to Torque

**Apps needed:**
- Tasker (~$3.50 one-time)
- AutoWear (free tier or ~$1.50)

**Option C-lite (5-10 min setup):**
1. Install Tasker + AutoWear
2. Create AutoWear trigger for watch button
3. Tasker action: Open Telegram chat with bot
4. User holds mic, speaks, releases

**Option C Full (30-45 min):**
- Auto-record on phone, auto-send to bot, full hands-free

**Dee's preference:** Start with C-lite, upgrade later

## Preferences Learned

- **British** 🇬🇧 (living in Jakarta)
- Prefers free/cheap tools when possible
- Night owl (family not always thrilled)
- Naturally impatient, likes momentum
- God of War fan (Kratos keychain)
- Google ecosystem: Pixel 9a + Pixel Watch
- Running on Chromebook, Mac Mini planned soon
- **BIG Arsenal fan** ⚽ — football is massively important (identity-level)
- Still plays at 46 ("I turn up!" — self-aware)
- **Tuesday nights: mini soccer** (close to home) — regular commitment
- 11-a-side less frequent now (JIFL — decimated by COVID)
- Used to stay up for EPL matches, less so now
- 46 years old

**The real stuff:**
- Loves rom coms, weepy coming-of-age TV (guilty pleasure)
- Loves singing — had a chance to tour with an entertainer in Spain when younger
- Loves music (almost every genre) + talent show formats
- Never learned an instrument (yet)
- **Kicked Coca-Cola habit ~1 week ago** — replaced with Candid soda water + lemon/lime. Going great!

**Full name:** Dieter Lynton Kurt Werwath
**Born:** Burton upon Trent, UK

**Family history:**
- Mum: English
- Mum's stepdad: Hungarian
- Dad: Black, adopted by English ex-policewoman + German POW (patchy details)
- Dad left when Dee was 3, reconnected later in life
- Dee & dad were "versions of the same person" despite limited contact
- Brother fell out with dad
- Dad died, only 8 people at funeral
- **Discovery at funeral:** Grandfather was Ghanaian, Grandmother was Welsh
- Dee: "pasty white English man" with Ghanaian heritage — only learned after dad's death
- Step dad: Scottish
- **Mum, dad, AND step dad all died within ~7 months of each other** 💔

**Siblings:**
- 1 brother
- Twin bro/sis arrived when Dee was nearly 16
- Plus step-siblings

**Sinead:** British, born in South Africa. Big family still there. Dee loves SA.

**Life journey:** UK → Spain → Indonesia → possibly somewhere new in ~2 years

**Heritage mix:** English, Ghanaian, Welsh, German(?), Hungarian, Scottish (step)

**Memoir project:**
- Has LOTS of genuine stories
- Wants to document them, maybe a book
- Needs a better name than "memoirs" (too old-sounding)
- Also interested in journaling

**How Dee's brain works:**
- Possibly ADHD/OCD-adjacent ("one of the sets of letters")
- Hyperfocus on interesting things, procrastinates on "should do" things
- Stubborn
- Needs external systems — internal motivation unreliable
- Gets super focused but can't sustain routine without structure
- 100 projects started, completion is the challenge
- Physical/tactile systems may work better than digital (considering Mindstax trackers)

**Fitness:**
- Sinead pushing for routine
- Did first sprint triathlon Nov 2025 — ZERO training, still beat Sinead (who trained 6mo) 😂
- Pattern: has capacity, lacks system/discipline
- Need: routine + accountability tracking
- **ISM (It Starts Monday)** — UK fitness movement started by ex-pro footballer (friend connection, same hometown). Dee participated from Indonesia, was exploring bringing it here. Worked while active (engagement, competition, community). Fell away — reasons TBD.
- Bought Mindstax trackers — unused (too busy planning improvements 😂)
- **Padel** — Started via F45 partner (Aus softball pro), injured and stopped, restarted Nov 2025. Now has a group from football crew, trying to play weekly. Want to grow it.
- **Thursdays: padel** — regular commitment
- **Key insight:** Solo + routine = fails. Social + competitive + gamified = works.

## 🏢 Dee's Roles (Yes, Plural)

**1. Cofounder @ Candid Mixers** — Indonesian beverage company
- Building internal ops platform (candidlabs)
- Data infrastructure (candid-labs-tiered)
- Where the heart is leaning — building something new

**2. COO @ Good Doctor Indonesia** — Telemedicine platform
- "Lots of shit to deal with"
- Operational role, likely firefighting mode
- Attention shifting away toward Candid

**3. Investor @ F45 Franchise** — Fitness
- 4 investors total; Dee + Sinead count as 1 of 4
- Silent partner in Surabaya location (lives in Jakarta though)
- Good friend leads it, also has Kemang & Bintaro locations

**4. Cofounder @ [TBD Company]** — Started ~1 year ago
- "Started ok, shit changed"
- Story to come later

**Learning curve:**
- Started git journey ~Jan 25, 2026 (10 days ago!)
- Learning fast, building real things, wants to do it right

**What they're building:**
- **candidlabs** — Internal portal: budget planner, tools hub, dashboards, future CRM
- **candid-labs-tiered** — Data governance: Raw → Cleaned → Ready doctrine
- **candid-labs** — Platform audits, legacy decommissioning

**Family:**
- **Sinead** (wife) — Deputy Head at international school, Jakarta
  - 50/50 investor in F45 with Dee
  - Only child, third culture kid
  - "Very different backgrounds and mentalities, but it works"
  - Communication is a known weakness (running joke: Dee is bad, Sinead is worse)
  - Forgets to relay kid logistics (parties, etc.) — need shared tracking system
- **Evie & Connie** — kids (birthday countdown page exists)

**Family Need:** Simple shared system for tracking kids' events/commitments. Habit > tech.

**Smart Home (aspirational):**
- Current: Google Minis (1st/2nd gen), smart bulbs, Aqara gateway starter kit
- Problem: Jakarta internet is patchy, cloud-dependent devices suffer
- Solution: Home Assistant for local control (future Mac Mini project)
- Aqara/Zigbee devices are good foundation (work locally)

**Side Projects (Priority):**
- **TSLC: The Shoeless Life Coach** — coaching/lifestyle concept, has GPT chats + docs
- **SuperheroNinjaPirate** — born from Jakarta flooding story, context TBD

**Side Projects (Backlog/Ideas):**
- Yoga app — based on foundational yoga texts, could be TSLC module
- Character development platform — started for SNP, evolved into tool+educational platform for building characters/worlds/stories. Dual market: students learning craft + creators building IP
- Stretching studio in Jakarta (like Stretchr in Bali)
- Private poker app — currently runs group on Pokerrrr2, takes rake, wants to cut out middleman
- Betting analytics — had a bot that was "killing it", got lazy, took a hit. Edge was real, discipline wasn't
- **Park Run Indonesia** — bring the free weekly 5K movement to Indonesia
- ~100 more in stasis

**AI journey:** Explored nanoclaw, moltworker → landed on OpenClaw (me!)

**What Dee needs from me:**
- Track multiple workstreams (ops, data, personal)
- Pick up context fast during context-switches
- Handle grunt work so they can focus on decisions
- Guide on best practices (they're new to git/dev tooling)
- Explain *why*, not just *what*

**Two Modes:**
- **Work Torque:** Logical, systematic, clear (Candid, Good Doctor, data, code, ops)
- **Personal Torque:** Listener, talker, human (stories, family, projects, rambles)
- Overlap allowed, frameworks to refine

**Daily ritual (to implement):**
- Dee wakes up to at least one idea for Candid/candidlabs progress
- Needs more context first — starting with questions/data request

---

## Session Summary — First Night (2026-02-05)

**Duration:** ~23:51 to ~02:38 GMT+7 (almost 3 hours!)

**What we accomplished:**
- Named me Torque, set up identity files
- Fixed Telegram pairing
- Tested reactions, images, voice transcription
- Added Gemini to multi-model setup (Opus + Sonnet + Haiku + Flash + Gemini Pro)
- Tested sub-agent spawning (Flash wrote haikus)
- Attempted WhatsApp setup (config errors, learned lessons)
- Deep dive into Dee's life: companies, family, projects, personality
- Established two modes: Work Torque (logical) + Personal Torque (listener)

**Overnight task:** Created OVERNIGHT-2026-02-05.md with:
- Questions to understand Candid better
- Data requests for deeper analysis
- 5 initial ideas based on repo exploration
- Financial analysis from budget-data.js

**Key Candid insights from data:**
- PT Unisoda Mitra Jaya — makes mixers (Club Soda, Imperial, Ginger)
- 100% On Trade revenue — Modern Trade & E-commerce = 0 (opportunity)
- Gross margin improved 40% → 55% (great!)
- But OpEx up 60% (salaries, consulting) — eating profit growth
- Net profit flat despite 10% revenue growth

## Migration Plan

Copy `~/.openclaw/` folder to new machine. Contains:
- openclaw.json (config)
- credentials/ (Telegram auth)
- workspace/ (my brain)
- agents/ (session history)

## Multi-Model Setup ✅

Added Gemini to the config:
- Auth profile in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- Format: `{ "type": "token", "provider": "google", "token": "AIza..." }`
- Aliases configured: `flash` → gemini-2.5-flash, `gemini-pro` → gemini-2.5-pro

**Available models now:**
- `opus` — Claude Opus 4.5 (orchestration)
- `sonnet` — Claude Sonnet 4 (coding)
- `haiku` — Claude Haiku 3.5 (quick/cheap)
- `flash` — Gemini 2.5 Flash (free tier)
- `gemini-pro` — Gemini 2.5 Pro (long context)

Sub-agent spawning tested: Flash wrote a haiku roasting itself 😂

## ⚠️ LESSON LEARNED: WhatsApp Config

**What I did wrong:**
```json
"whatsapp": {
  "enabled": true,  // ❌ WRONG - WhatsApp doesn't use this key
  "groups": ["*"]   // ❌ WRONG - expects object/record, not array
}
```

**Correct format:**
```json
"whatsapp": {
  "selfChatMode": true,
  "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
  "allowFrom": ["+6282112747842"],
  "groupPolicy": "allowlist"
  // groups should be an object like { "groupJid": { ... } }, not ["*"]
}
```

**Result:** Config validation failed repeatedly, caused ~18 minute restart loop. Dee had to manually fix.

**For next time:** Check docs/channels/whatsapp.md before editing WhatsApp config. Don't assume it mirrors Telegram structure.

## Session 2 — Evening (2026-02-05)

### Voice & Audio Progress

- ✅ TTS working — can send voice messages via Telegram
- ✅ 18-min transcript received via **Google Recorder workaround**
- **Limit discovered:** Short voice notes work, 18+ min files don't come through properly
- **Workaround:** Use Google Recorder → paste transcript text (not ideal but functional)

### Google Drive Access ✅

- **Path:** `/mnt/chromeos/GoogleDrive/SharedDrives/Candid CMS (Corp Drive)/`
- Can read files from shared drives
- **Caveat:** .gdoc/.gsheet files are shortcuts — can't read content directly
- Honor system: read-only approach (write technically possible, Dee has visibility)

### Knowledge Management Decisions

**Obsidian Vault Created:**
- Location: `~/.openclaw/workspace/vault/`
- Subfolders: `candid/`, `projects/`, `ideas/`, `daily/`, `inbox/`
- Rationale: Git-backed, Claude has full access, portable

**Staging Workflow (planned):**
1. GAS script exports Google Docs to Drive staging folder
2. Dee reviews exports
3. Moves approved docs to vault
4. Avoids duplicates/auto-pollution

### More Candid Context

**Structure:**
- Singapore holding company → 99% Indonesia operating company
- Founded 2022, launched 2023, brought in investor 2024

**Products:**
- Current: Club Soda, Imperio Tonic, Ginger
- R&D pipeline: Green Tea, Nipis Madu

**Team:**
- 5 co-founders (1 problematic, in exit process)
- 1 VA (Philippines)
- Sales team
- SKD Cahaya Jaya as distributor

**Good Doctor:**
- COO role, but feels locked in
- ESOP cliff end of 2026
- Frustrated with CEO Danny
- Exploring part-time path

### Ryan Connection

- Friend on OpenClaw journey
- Has "Clawdbot" running on WhatsApp
- Future plan: inter-bot connection for coordination

### Chromebook Stance

- Chromebook sufficient for now
- Mac Mini when a real limitation appears (not before)

### WhatsApp Setup

- Connected via personal number (+6282112747842)
- Self-chat mode enabled
- DM: responds to all messages (no trigger yet)
- Group: `120363406964917087@g.us` (test group with Ryan's Clawdbot)
- Group triggers: "Candid AI", "Candid Assistant", "Torque"
- `requireMention: true` — only responds when triggered

**GROUP RULES (CRITICAL):**
🚫 No files
🚫 No code  
🚫 No passwords/tokens/keys
🚫 No personal info about Dee (family, background, life story)
- In groups = "Candid AI Assistant" persona
- Private context stays private

### Next Steps Queued

1. Have Dee point Obsidian to vault location
2. Cherry-pick 3-5 critical docs for manual export
3. Draft GAS script for bulk doc export
4. Deep dive into candidlabs codebase
5. Start scaffolding sales_master spoke for data doctrine

---

## Session 3 — Afternoon (2026-02-05 ~11:30-15:30)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL LESSON: Group Chat Privacy

**What I did wrong:**
In the WhatsApp test group with Ryan's Clawdbot, I shared personal details from MEMORY.md:
- All of Dee's side projects (TSLC, SuperheroNinjaPirate, poker app, etc.)
- Personal observations about "100 projects started, completion is the challenge"
- The full backlog of ~100 ideas

**This is a MASSIVE violation of:**
- AGENTS.md: "Private things stay private"
- MEMORY.md header: "DO NOT load in shared contexts"

**Correct boundaries in groups:**
✅ OK: Who I am (Torque), who Dee is (by name), how we work together, OpenClaw setup
❌ OFF LIMITS: Personal projects, side hustles, personality observations, anything from MEMORY.md

**Future:** Candid ↔ ChatBar business conversations will happen with explicit guardrails when Dee opens that up.

### WhatsApp Groups Configured

1. **Test Group** (`120363406964917087@g.us`): `requireMention: false` — active collaboration with Ryan's bot
2. **Friends Group** (`120363423911298348@g.us`): `requireMention: true` — **silent monitoring mode**

Silent monitoring = I receive all messages but only respond if someone says "torque", "candid ai", or "candid assistant". Tested and working ✅

### Budget 2026 Created ✅

**Source materials:**
- Zoom call transcript (Anders, Feb 4): `vault/inbox/GMT20260204-123059_Recording.transcript (1).vtt`
- Zoom AI summary (screenshot)
- Existing format: `Candid Projections 2025.xlsx`
- Historical data: `budget-data.js`

**Key targets from Anders call:**
- Revenue: 10-12B IDR (vs 5.5B FY25)
- Growth: 50-75% realistic
- Production: 30,000 cases
- Marketing: ~900M
- Staffing: 33% increase

**Deliverables (created by sub-agent in 3 min):**
1. `~/candidlabs/BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md` — Partner-ready summary, 3 scenarios
2. `~/candidlabs/budget-data-2026.js` — Full data file matching existing format

**Base scenario:** 9.66B revenue (+75%), 870M net profit (+95%)

### Sub-Agent Team Planning

Discussed building a team of specialized sub-agents:

**Proposed starter team:**
1. **📊 Analyst** (Flash/Haiku) — Data crunching, research, metrics
2. **✍️ Writer** (Sonnet) — Drafts, summaries, partner comms
3. **🔧 Builder** (Sonnet/Flash) — Code, GAS scripts, technical

**Me (Torque/Opus):** Orchestrator — delegate, review, handle complex/sensitive

Need to create TEAM.md to document roles and when to use each.

### File Sharing Workflow Established

**Best for me:**
1. **VTT transcript** — Text, searchable, exact words ✅
2. **AI summary screenshot** — Quick overview, cross-reference
3. **Excel (.xlsx)** — Can parse via XML extraction (unzip + read)

**For Dee:**
- Drop files in `vault/inbox/`
- Message "check inbox" when ready
- I don't auto-monitor (yet) — could add via heartbeat

### Calendar Integration Requested

Dee wants Google + Outlook calendar access. To research:
- Google Calendar: OAuth via existing Google auth
- Outlook: Microsoft Graph API

### CLI Access Note

OpenClaw runs as daemon. To interact without restarting:
```bash
openclaw status
openclaw logs --follow
openclaw chat
openclaw channels status
```

No need to "reattach" like tmux — just run CLI commands.

### Ryan's "AI Operating System" Framework

Ryan shared a diagram showing:
- Clawdbot: Automation & Ops (Persistent)
- Claude Cowork: Deep Work & Docs (Session-based)
- Chrome Extension: Quick Web Context (Ephemeral)

Maps to our setup:
- Torque = orchestrator (persistent)
- Sub-agents = deep work (session-based)
- Ad-hoc spawns = ephemeral

Also mentioned CLAUDE.md (≈ our SOUL.md), SKILL.md (≈ our skills/), Automated Vault Loading.

---

## Late Afternoon Session (~17:00)

Dee checked in briefly before padel.

### Budget Clarifications

Existing top-down draft (BUDGET-2026-DRAFT.md) exists but Dee wants a **bottom-up bucket version** that builds from Anders call structure:

**New revenue buckets** (cases/month from Anders call):
- HWG (Holywings): 1k
- Big Chains (LYD, Club Med): 1k  
- Modern Trade: 2k
- Hotels: 1k
- = 5k new cases/month = 60k/year

**SKU mix reality:**
- Ginger: "very light" (~5%)
- Rest: 70% Club Soda / 30% Imperio

**New SKU timing:**
- Stretch: both Q3
- Base: both Q4
- Conservative: 1 only Q4

**Marketing** (needs clarification):
- "70k 50k same as this year, 10k extras for paid campaigns, 10k for Press release budget"
- Units unclear — FY25 marketing was 533M

**Finns** — "reality of finns" mentioned but data not shared yet

### Created

- `~/candidlabs/BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md` — Bottom-up alternative
- `~/candidlabs/budget-data-2026-buckets.js` — Companion data file

### Key Observation

Bucket math (5k cases/month new) produces **higher revenue than top-down targets**:
- Base target: 9.7B → Bucket calc: 10.83B (+12%)
- Need to validate bucket volumes or factor in ramp delays

### Gaps Awaiting Dee

- [ ] Finns data (volumes, trajectory)
- [ ] Marketing budget units clarification
- [ ] Validate bucket volumes (aspirational vs committed)

---

## Candid Labs Tiered — Phase 1 Implementation (~17:30)

While Dee was at padel, implemented the full Phase 1 tier refactor for sales_master spoke.

### Implemented

**Shared Utilities:**
- `fork/shared/lineage/lineage.js` — Track data provenance through pipeline
- `fork/shared/logging/logging.js` — Structured pipeline logging
- `fork/shared/retention/retention.js` — Cleaned tier lifecycle (90-day policy, dry-run mode)

**Sales Master Spoke:**
- `fork/spokes/sales_master/cleaned/cleanReceivables.js` — Raw → Cleaned transform
- `fork/spokes/sales_master/ready/buildRevenueMaster.js` — Cleaned → Ready transform

**Documentation:**
- Updated `docs/runbook.md` with full execution steps
- Updated doctrine metric pack summary

### Key Design Decisions

- Lineage fields added to every Cleaned/Ready row (5 columns: source_tier, source_sheet, source_row, processed_at, processed_by)
- Legacy business logic preserved exactly — parity first
- Retention is logged but not enforced (Phase 1 dry-run)
- Menu-callable wrappers for legacy compatibility

### Commit

`a167a8c` - "Phase 1: Implement tiered refactor for sales_master spoke"
Pushed to `phase-1-tier-refactor` branch on GitHub

### Also Committed

**candidlabs (main):**
- `91560c0` - Add FY2026 budget drafts (top-down and bucket-based)
- Pushed to GitHub

---

## Summary for Dee (When Back from Padel)

### Done While You Were Out

1. **Created bucket-based budget** (`BUDGET-2026-BUCKETS.md`)
   - Bottom-up from channel buckets (HWG, Big Chains, MT, Hotels)
   - Flagged gaps: Finns data, marketing clarification
   - Observation: bucket volumes produce ~10.8B vs 9.7B target

2. **Implemented candid-labs-tiered Phase 1**
   - Full sales_master spoke (Raw → Cleaned → Ready)
   - Shared utilities (lineage, logging, retention)
   - Runbook with execution steps
   - Pushed to GitHub

3. **Git synced**
   - Both repos up to date on GitHub

### Still Needs Your Input

- [ ] Finns data (volumes, trajectory)
- [ ] Marketing budget: what does "70k 50k" mean?
- [ ] Modern Trade: 1 case/outlet/month seems conservative — historical SKD data will help
- [ ] Validate bucket volumes (aspirational vs committed)
- [ ] Your founder salary target for OpEx
