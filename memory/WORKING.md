## Current Focus
**Unlocking cheaper models for sub-agents**

## Status
- Confirmed MAX OAuth only grants Opus API access
- Need separate pay-per-use API key for Haiku/Sonnet
- Dee grabbing API key from console.anthropic.com (at BBQ, will do when back)

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Dee: Get API key from console.anthropic.com
2. [ ] Torque: Add key as new auth profile (`anthropic:cheap`)
3. [ ] Torque: Point subagents to use Haiku via new profile
4. [ ] Test sub-agent spawn

## Blockers
- Waiting on Dee for API key (at family BBQ)
