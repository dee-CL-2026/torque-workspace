## Early Morning Session (05:20 - 06:30+)

### Context
Dee returned from wedding breakfast that ran all day → post-work drinks with Sinead → 5am catchup session to address the core problem: I keep saying I'll do things but don't actually finish them.

---

## The Core Problem Identified

**Pattern:** 
1. Dee asks me to do X
2. I say "I'll do X" 
3. Session compacts or ends
4. No record of X anywhere
5. Next session, I have no idea

**Root cause:** No persistent task tracking. "Mental notes" don't survive.

## What We Built Tonight

### 1. Task System

**tasks.md** — Active tasks only
- Table format: Task | Assigned | Status | Added | Notes
- Statuses: pending → in-progress → blocked → done
- Assignees: Dee, Torque, sub-agents (gas-dev, frontend, analyst, etc.), human staff

**tasks-done.md** — Archive for completed tasks
- Keeps tasks.md lean
- Provides history trail

### 2. HEARTBEAT.md Redesign

Changed from "check one low-value thing" to actual orchestration:

1. Check tasks.md
2. Assign unassigned tasks (from team/TEAM.md roster)
3. Torque tasks → start directly (or spawn torque-worker)
4. Sub-agent tasks → spawn, note session label in Notes
5. Human/Dee tasks → leave pending
6. In-progress sub-agents → check via sessions_list
7. Done → move to tasks-done.md
8. Check vault/inbox for new items (with duplicate checking)

### 3. 5-Minute Heartbeat (Test Mode)

Changed from 30m to 5m for rapid testing. **Remember to change back after testing.**

## Tasks Captured (17 total)

From vault/inbox/Torque Catchup files:

**Assigned to Dee (7):**
- Send 2024-2025 financial data to Anders
- Ask Ryan for pitch deck + 3 marketing scenarios
- Follow up: Teddy (KKS), PKF (Cheryl), Jules (zero cap accounts)
- Push SKD for sales data
- Get Ferry involved in all groups
- Get Finns co-branding contract

**Assigned to Torque (4):**
- Budget draft (Anders call) — IN PROGRESS
- Connect Google calendar
- Connect Outlook calendar
- Process YouTube watchlist (7 videos)

**Assigned to Sub-agents (5):**
- Build SKU library → gas-dev
- Candid Labs tiered/fork → gas-dev
- Command Centre improvements → frontend
- Candid Daily Cockpit dashboard → frontend
- Metric to raw data mapping → analyst ✅ COMPLETED

## Sub-agent Spawning Issue

Spawned 5 agents at once → all hit Gemini free tier rate limit (5 req/min)

**Error:** `generate_content_free_tier_requests limit: 5`

**Fix:** Use haiku instead of flash for sub-agents. Dee has Claude Max ($100) so no cost concern.

**Analyst task succeeded** because it used Anthropic model (not Gemini).

---

## Key Architectural Insight

**Torque should be pure orchestrator, not worker.**

If I do work directly:
- Blocked from responding to Dee
- Can't orchestrate anything else
- Single-threaded

If I only orchestrate + spawn:
- Stay responsive
- Multiple sub-agents work in parallel
- Just check status, route work, report back

**Possible rule:** Quick tasks (< 2 min) do directly. Anything substantial → spawn `torque-worker`.

---

## Team Roster Exists

Found yesterday's work at `team/TEAM.md`:
- Full org structure with roles
- Models specified per role
- Spawn patterns documented

Also: `team/wa-monitor.md` job description exists.

---

## Files Created/Modified

- `tasks.md` — created with 17 tasks
- `tasks-done.md` — created as archive
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — completely rewritten
- `candid/METRIC-DATA-MAPPING.md` — created by analyst sub-agent

---

## Config Changes

- Heartbeat interval: 30m → 5m (TEST MODE)

---

## Still TODO

- [ ] Change heartbeat back to 30m after testing
- [ ] Update team/TEAM.md to use haiku instead of flash
- [ ] Retry failed sub-agent tasks with haiku
- [ ] Consider torque-worker sub-agent for deep work
- [ ] Fix Gemini auth (hitting free tier, not paid subscription)

## Key Quote from Dee

> "We have said that a lot, let's make sure it sticks this time!"

The difference this time: actually built the system, tested it, identified failure modes (Gemini rate limits), have clear rules in HEARTBEAT.md.
