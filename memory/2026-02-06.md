## Morning Session (06:23 - 09:33+)

### Critical Learning: I Missed A LOT

**What I claimed to do overnight:**
- Research agents running
- 6am Sinead intro scheduled
- Aaron intro sent
- Budget work in progress

**What actually happened:**
- Sinead intro: Set for 7am not 6am, needed manual trigger at 07:07
- Research agents: Never actually ran
- Overnight work: Mostly just heartbeats, no proactive work
- Lost context from session compaction — didn't persist to memory files

### Key Lesson: TALK ≠ DONE
If it's not written to a file, it didn't happen. "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts.

## What I Actually Accomplished Today

### ✅ Done (with timestamps)
- 06:33 — Morning report cron set up (7am daily)
- 06:40 — Command Centre v0.1 built
- 07:07 — Sinead intro FINALLY sent to family group "It's All Torque"
- 07:08 — Context folders created (family/, friends/, candid/)
- 07:08 — Aaron & Ryan contact files with JIDs
- 08:10 — Cloudflare Pages deployed (`torque-works.pages.dev`)
- 08:14 — Data loading fixed (GitHub raw URLs)
- 08:29 — Tasks updated with proper completion timestamps

### Command Centre Live!
- URL: `https://torque-works.pages.dev`
- Auto-deploys from GitHub on push
- Shows: Tasks, Agent Roster, System Status, Pulse Monitor
- Layout: Side-by-side Active/Backlog (scrollable)
- Data: Fetches from GitHub raw URLs

## Contact System Restructured

**New folder structure with JID mapping:**

```
family/          ← JID: 120363426498709975@g.us (It's All Torque)
├── sinead.md
├── evie.md
└── connie.md

friends/         
├── ryan.md      ← JIDs: Synthetic Bros, AI Power Users
└── aaron.md     ← JID: 120363404970214457@g.us

candid/          ← Work contacts (to populate)
└── README.md
```

**Rule:** Only load context from folder matching the group JID. Never cross-contaminate family↔candid.

## WhatsApp Groups (Updated TOOLS.md)

| JID | Name | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `120363406964917087@g.us` | Synthetic Bros | Ryan's test group |
| `120363423911298348@g.us` | AI Power Users Club | Friends, silent monitoring |
| `120363426498709975@g.us` | It's All Torque | Family — Sinead |
| `120363404970214457@g.us` | OpenClaw for Aaron | Ryan + Aaron |

---

## Cloudflare Setup

- **Account:** Dee's personal Gmail
- **Pages project:** `torque-works` (not `torque-workspace` — name conflict)
- **Deployed folder:** `command-centre/` only
- **Auto-deploy:** On git push to master
- **Future:** Add Cloudflare Access for login, Tunnel for remote Chromebook access

### Pages Setup Gotcha
- First attempt created Workers project (needs wrangler deploy command)
- Solution: Use "+Add" → "Pages" specifically, not the main "Create application" flow
- Workers ≠ Pages — different deployment models

---

## Chat Export Discovery

**Problem:** Lost context from last night's session, no export function in Telegram browser.

**Solution:** Use Claude in Chrome to:
1. Screenshot Telegram messages
2. Read via vision
3. Type formatted content into Google Doc

**Format that works:**
```
[13:09 DEE]: message text
---
[13:10 TORQUE]: response
---
```

This is a reusable workflow for capturing chat history!

---

## What I Was SUPPOSED To Do Yesterday (from export)

**Three main tasks assigned at 13:09:**
1. Budget draft (Anders call) — extract from Zoom transcript, create partner summary
2. Candid Labs (platform + site) — review repos, spawn sub-agents
3. WhatsApp silent monitoring research — test with friends group

**My 15:18 status update claimed:**
- ✅ WhatsApp silent monitoring working
- ✅ Parsed source files (transcript, Excel, budget data)
- ✅ Extracted key numbers from Anders call
- ❌ Budget draft files not created — got sidetracked

**So I did SOME work but didn't finish the deliverables.**

---

## Today's Events

- **10:00** — Wedding breakfast (6-7 min from house)
- Sinead at school 7am-4pm

---

## Tasks Status

**Active:**
- Improve Command Centre layout (side-by-side done, more to do)

**Backlog (key items):**
- Process YouTube watchlist (7 videos)
- Deploy tiered fork to GAS
- Agent roster stats (active/backlog per agent)
- Cloudflare tunnel setup
- Token usage tracking

**Done today:** 7 items with timestamps

---

## Dashboard Improvements Requested

1. Active/Backlog side-by-side ✅
2. Recent Activity scrollable ✅
3. Agent roster stats (tasks per agent) — backlog
4. Channel indicators (Gateway 🟢, Telegram 🟢, WhatsApp 🟢) — TODO
5. Session summary (tokens, context %) — TODO
6. Possibly tabs: Overview | Tasks | Activity | Team
7. Move System Status to footer

---

## Key People Context

**Aaron (Milburn?):**
- 🥝 Kiwi, Aussie wife
- 3 kids (2 eldest ≈ Evie & Connie's ages, same school, friends)
- Close family friend
- Getting set up with OpenClaw
- Rules: Tech buddy mode, NO Candid details, NO deep personal stuff

**Ryan:**
- OpenClaw buddy, has Clawdbot
- In Synthetic Bros + AI Power Users groups

*Session ongoing — Dee showering, Claude exporting chat history*

## Dee's Vision: Team Structure & Workflow (10:20 voice note)

### Key Direction

**1. Work Separation**
- Two main contexts: **Candid** and **Good Doctor**
- Need way to differentiate tasks/projects between them
- Both feed into same system but tagged separately

**2. Meeting Transcript Pipeline**
- Record ALL meetings (Zoom for online, Recorder for offline)
- Transcripts → vault/inbox → processed → action items + summaries
- This is "secretarial" work — dedicated agent role

**3. Agent Autonomy Levels**
- Some tasks: Just do them (no approval needed)
- Some tasks: Draft/start, then surface for review
- Orchestrator (Torque) decides routing

**4. Dashboard Additions Needed**
- Ideas section (separate from backlog)
- Discussion points
- Work context indicators (Candid vs Good Doctor)

**5. Daily Idea Feature**
- One idea every morning
- Not just tech/tools — business ideas, initiatives
- "Knowing everything you know about me, what can help push forward?"

**6. Overnight Builds**
- Reference: YouTube video about agent shipping something every night
- Scope, build, ship while Dee sleeps

### Priority: Lock in basics
- Commit everything to MD files
- Proper sorting/location rules
- Use timestamps for backlog retrieval
- By end of day: Command Centre should look "a lot busier"

## Accomplished (continued)

- 09:56 — WA Monitor added to team roster
- 10:20 — WA Monitor job description created (`team/wa-monitor.md`)
