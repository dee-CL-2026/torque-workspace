*Late night session continuing from Feb 5*

## Major Wins

### Watch → WhatsApp → Torque Working! 🎉
- Spent 45+ min on AutoWear/IFTTT rabbit hole (frustrating)
- Solution was simple: WhatsApp already on watch
- Self-chat + pinned chats = 3 most important contacts one swipe away
- Lesson: Check obvious native solutions before complex tooling

### Command Centre Live
- Built MVP dashboard in ~10 min
- Live at: https://dee-cl-2026.github.io/torque-workspace/
- Card-based layout: Tasks, Team, Session stats, Activity log
- Dark theme, mobile-friendly
- Modular cards for easy iteration

### Team Expanded
- Added **Secretary** role (bulk processing grunt)
- Model: flash, no personality, high throughput
- Handles: bulk downloads, file org, data entry at scale
- Team now: torque, pa, gas-dev, secretary (4 ready)

### Knowledge Layer Architecture
- Created `vault/architecture/KNOWLEDGE-LAYER.md`
- Three-layer model based on Dee's NLM/Gems strategy:
  1. Truth Layer (vault) — canonical docs
  2. Reasoning Layer (agents) — think from truth
  3. Exploration Layer (drafts) — before graduation
- Lots of [[wiki links]] for Obsidian graph

---

## Tasks Added
1. Token usage tracking for Command Centre (medium, frontend)
2. Watch button shortcut research (low, analyst)
3. Deploy tiered fork to GAS (high, gas-dev)

---

## Ideas Captured
- **"It's All Torque"** — podcast/blog about the journey
- Backlog card for Command Centre
- Full site with navigation (like Candid budget.html)
- NLM-style capabilities via Obsidian + agents

---

## Config Changes
- Heartbeat enabled (30 min interval)
- GitHub Pages enabled for torque-workspace
- SSH server started (for mobile access via Termius)

---

## Learnings / Notes to Self
- Dee has vivid mental blueprints — ask clarifying questions before building
- I assign tasks (orchestrator role), not Dee
- Check obvious/native solutions before complex tooling
- Dee not a big social media guy

---

## Reminders Set
- 12:30am gentle nudge (tonight)
- Tomorrow 12pm: Explore Obsidian vault + Knowledge Layer doc

---

## Files Created
- `~/.openclaw/workspace/command-centre/` → moved to `/docs/` for GitHub Pages
- `vault/architecture/KNOWLEDGE-LAYER.md`
- `team/agents/secretary.md`
- `data/tasks.json` (with 3 real tasks)
- `research/SSH-CLIENTS-ANDROID.md`
- `NOTES-TO-SELF.md`

---

## Session Stats (at compaction)
- Context: ~147k/200k (72%+)
- Sub-agents run: 5+ tonight
- Model: claude-opus-4-5
