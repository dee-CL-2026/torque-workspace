## Executive Summary

### Strategic Positioning for 2026
A "steady growth and optimization" year focused on:
- **Doubling revenue** from 2025 baseline (~10-12B IDR target)
- **Stabilizing operations** after turbulent 2025 distributor transition
- **Building foundation** for senior hire (Elliott-level) and funding round
- **Reducing volatility** - less bumpy, more consistent monthly sales

### Key Milestones
| Target | Timeline | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Full-time founder operational | Current | ✅ In place |
| Elliott-level senior hire | Q3-Q4 2026 | Conditional on SKD performance |
| 2 new SKUs launched | H2 2026 | Conservative: Q4, Base: Q3+Q4, Stretch: Both Q3 |
| 30K case production runs | 2x/year | Unlock COGS savings |
| 5K+ cases/month baseline | Mid-2026 | Threshold for stability |

### Success Criteria (per Anders)
> "A good 2026 is progress from 2025, full-time founder, plus Elliott, plus new SKUs. We don't want to lose money, we want to move forward."

## Revenue Projections

### 2025 Baseline Context
- Revenue grew but significantly below 2.5X target set
- ~25% of projected performance achieved
- H1 2025 effectively lost to distributor transition
- SKD still in "bedding in" period

### 2026 Revenue Model: "2025 + X"

**Approach:** Take 2025 actuals, add known/near opportunities, apply conservative growth

| Revenue Stream | Monthly Cases | Annual Cases | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **Existing Business** | ~2,500 | ~30,000 | 2025 baseline + organic growth |
| **Holywings** | 1,000 | 12,000 | Conservative (they quoted 10K/year) |
| **Groups (Club Med, LYD, etc.)** | 1,000 | 12,000 | Combined hotel chains |
| **Modern Trade Listings** | 2,000 | 24,000 | 2,000 outlets × 1 case/month |
| **Finns Beach Club** | 1,250 | 15,000 | Currently 1,000-1,500/month |
| **New SKUs (H2)** | TBD | TBD | Conservative estimate only |
| **TOTAL (Conservative)** | ~7,750 | ~93,000 | |

### Scenario Modeling

| Scenario | Cases/Month | Annual Revenue Target | Growth vs 2025 |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Conservative** | 6,000-7,000 | 8-9B IDR | ~50% |
| **Base** | 7,500-8,500 | 10-12B IDR | ~100% (2X) |
| **Stretch** | 10,000+ | 15B+ IDR | ~150%+ |

**Key Assumptions:**
- No overseas revenue budgeted (upside only)
- Peak season adds 20-30% to baseline
- Ginger excluded from volume projections (limited demand)
- New SKUs contribute H2 only

### Revenue Risks & Upsides

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SKD sales inconsistency | Monthly BD calls, direct chain relationships |
| Holywings underperformance | Budget conservatively at 1K/month |
| Listing delays | Streamlined onboarding from 2025 learnings |

| Upside | Potential Impact |
|--------|------------------|
| Aviation deals (via SKD) | Steady, recurring volume |
| Bintan hotels | Additional market |
| Retail chain expansion | 2K+ outlets achievable |
| Overseas production licensing | "Totally different level" |

---

## Cost Structure

### COGS Analysis

| Metric | 2025 Actual | 2026 Target | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Gross Margin % | ~45% | 50%+ | Improvement expected |
| COGS as % Revenue | ~55% | 50% or lower | Volume-driven |

**COGS Reduction Levers:**
1. **30K case production runs** (2x/year) - major cost savings
2. **Volume discounts** from KMI at higher quantities
3. **Reduced per-unit logistics** with larger shipments

### Operating Expenses (OPEX)

| Category | 2025 Baseline | 2026 Budget | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Salaries (existing)** | Base | +3% minimum | Merzon increase done Dec 2025 |
| **Senior Hire (Elliott-type)** | — | TBD Q3/Q4 | $XX,XXX/month range |
| **Third Sales Rep** | — | Add early 2026 | Jules/Merzon + 1 |
| **Marketing (Ryan)** | ~$48-50K | $60K | Per Ryan's request |
| **Press Releases** | — | ~$9.2K | 4x quarterly @ $2.3K |
| **Finance (PKF)** | Existing | Stable | No major changes |
| **Legal/Consulting** | High in 2025 | Reduced | One-time costs cleared |
| **Listing Fees** | Variable | TBD | Negotiate directly with chains |
| **BPAC** | Ongoing | Ongoing | Annual requirement |

### Marketing Budget Detail

**Total Marketing: ~$70K** (900M IDR base + campaigns)

| Component | Amount | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Base retainer (Ryan) | ~$50K | Monthly |
| Campaign spend | $10K | Ramadan + key periods |
| Press releases | $9.2K | Quarterly |
| Activations/sampling | TBD | As needed |

> "Ramp up ASAP, then maintenance campaign for Ramadan" - Ryan

## Key Assumptions

### Growth Rates
| Assumption | Value | Confidence |
|------------|-------|------------|
| Overall revenue growth | 2X (100%) | Base case |
| SKD year-1 growth (original target) | 25% | Unlikely in H2 2025 |
| SKD year-2 growth (original target) | 10% | Baseline |
| Minimum acceptable growth | 50-75% | Per Anders |

### Volume Assumptions
| Assumption | Value | Source |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Case per outlet/month (listings) | 1 case | Conservative estimate |
| Target outlet count | 2,000 | From current 300+ |
| Holywings monthly | 1,000 cases | Their 10K/year → conservative |
| Finns monthly | 1,250 cases | Current 1-1.5K average |
| Peak season multiplier | +20-30% | Historical pattern |

### Production Assumptions
| Assumption | Value | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Shelf life | 2 years | SKD prefers 12+ months remaining |
| Safe storage duration | 12 months | Proven with Ginger |
| 30K batch breakeven | 5K cases/month sales | Enables bulk production |
| Production runs | 2x/year at scale | For COGS optimization |

### Staffing Assumptions
| Assumption | Value | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Salary increases | +3% minimum | Across existing team |
| New sales rep | Early 2026 | Third field person |
| Senior hire (Elliott-type) | Q3-Q4 | Conditional on revenue |
| Risma | Exit | Ferry takes over |

### SKD Performance Triggers
To afford Elliott-level hire:
- SKD ordering **5,000+ cases/month** (2× large trucks + 1 small)
- Jakarta: 2,600 cases/month
- Bali: 2,600 + 900 cases/month
- **Total: ~6,100 cases/month minimum**

> "If we had that level of stability... that salary would be just about in reach."

## Notes for Dee

### Things to Validate
1. **2025 actual revenue number** - transcript shows 445M somewhere, verify with PKF
2. **Elliott salary range** - need to confirm for hire threshold calculation
3. **Listing fee breakdown** - get actual costs from recent chains
4. **SKD's stated targets** - 25% Y1, 10% Y2 - are they still holding to this?

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Fill in actual 2025 numbers from PKF final report
2. Get Ryan's marketing scenarios in writing
3. Model Elliott hire threshold more precisely
4. Add month-by-month breakdown (tool supports this)
5. Share with Anders/Al for input before wider team

### Open Questions
- **P&B FOC buyout**: What's the real number? They bought at 48/68
- **Holywings timeline**: Confirmed Feb launch?
- **New SKUs**: What are SKU 4 and 5 specifically?
- **Singapore loan**: $12-15K - timing for repayment?
